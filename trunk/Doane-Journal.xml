            <p> This edition is the latest in a series of collaboratively produced electronic
               editions of previously unpublished nineteenth-century American manuscripts held in
               the Rare Books and Manuscripts Library at The Ohio State University. Previous
               editions include "My Dear Elizabeth," five letters written by Sophia Peabody
               Hawthorne to her sister Elizabeth Palmer Peabody between ca. 1837 and 1868 (currently
               being revised), and "Dear Wife" twenty-one letters written by riverboat captain
               William B. Anderson to his wife Louisa while he plied the Ohio river during the
               height of the American Civil War, 1862–1864. These documentary editions are intended
               to provide wide exposure and access to manuscripts that might otherwise be difficult
               for scholars to discover and consult, and to provide users with a variety of tools
               for studying those texts. </p>
            <p> Each text was edited in connection with an undergraduate or graduate course offered
               by H. Lewis Ulman, Associate Professor of English at The Ohio State University. The
               courses aim to provide students with an opportunity to explore issues of textuality
               and mediation that arise when our cultural archives spread from page to screen and
               from library shelves to networked databases. Electronic textual editing is our
               vehicle for examining what happens—and envisioning what might happen—when artifacts
               in one medium are represented in another medium, especially with regard to the
               interpretive work of reading. Electronic textual editions also provide a contact zone
               that can help us reflect on what manuscript, print, and "born digital" artifacts can
               tell us about their relationships to one another and their unique properties. </p>
            <p> While providing a reliable textual edition is a <foreign xml:lang="lat">sine qua
                  non</foreign>, the Cox edition also explores ways of telling four stories
               inextricably woven into our work: the lives and historical milieu evoked by the
               texts, the history of the physical journal (including its recent restoration), the
               editorial process that gave rise to this particular interpretation of the text, and
               the mediation of our electronic delivery system. </p>

               full quality before being loaded into the Media Manager application. All edges were
               overscanned by at least 1/4 inch. No color correction was used at any stage of image
               preparation, but a scan of a photographer's 18% grey card on the same scanner
               produced RGB values at the center of 91/95/107 after applying a 150% Gaussian Blur in
               Adobe Photoshop to average color values. Thus, a properly configured monitor should
               provide a reasonable approximation of colors on the manuscript pages. The pages were
               scanned while the original journal was disbound for restoration. As a result, the
               page images contain penciled page numbers in the lower left- or right-hand corners.
               The numbers were erased after the volume was reassembled and rebound. </p>

               &quot;type='Entry'&quot;, constitutes the primary textual structure represented in
               the markup. Each entry contains an &lt;opener&gt; element—which in turn contains a
