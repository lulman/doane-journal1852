                     <p><hi rend="bold">Health and Medicine in the 19th-Century Merchant Marine</hi></p>
                     <p>One of the topics <persName ref="#LAD">Louisa Doane</persName> discusses in detail in <rs ref="#LAD">her</rs> journal is that of health.  
                        <rs ref="#LAD">Her</rs> concern in reporting on this topic reflects a broader interest in the health and 
                        medical treatment of sailors and sea-travelers evidenced in publications of the time. 
                        The <date when="1842-12-31">December 31, 1842</date> issue of <title level="m">The Friend: A Religious and Literary Journal</title> reprints 
                        a review of the new edition of <title level="m">Physician for Ships</title> which originally appeared in the 
                        <title level="m">Boston Medical and Surgical Review</title>.  The reviewer remarks favorably on the volume, 
                        saying, "Sailors suffer exceedingly for the want of medical advice.  All vessels, 
                        or nearly all, have a medicine chest, but no medical directions worthy of credence...Our 
                        merchants ought to put a copy on board of every vessel leaving port" <bibl><ref target="#BMSS">107</ref></bibl>.  
                        <persName ref="#LAD">Doane</persName> makes no mention of such a book on board the ships <rs ref="#LAD">she</rs> sails on, but <persName ref="#LAD">Doane</persName> does 
                        mention <rs ref="#LAD">her</rs> <rs ref="#END">father</rs> administering medicine on several occasions.  The picture <persName ref="#LAD">Louisa 
                           Doane</persName> draws of seafaring medicine, therefore, shows <rs ref="#LAD">her</rs> <rs ref="#END">father</rs> as the chief medical 
                        man on board, diagnosing and dispensing according to <rs ref="#END">his</rs> judgment, and often with the 
                        help of <persName ref="#LAD">Doane</persName> and <rs ref="#LAD">her</rs> <rs ref="#ATD">mother</rs>.  Significantly, the quality of care that the men receive 
                        under <persName ref="#END">Captain Doane’s</persName> command stands in contrast to that received by <persName ref="#LAD">Doane</persName> and <rs ref="#LAD">her</rs> <rs ref="#END">father</rs> 
                        on shore from a licensed physician.  With some historical context, one may read <persName ref="#LAD">Doane’s</persName> 
                        journal as evidence of how the differential care of sailors and individuals at sea versus 
                        on land highlighted class differences, and particularly demonstrates the common disregard 
                        for the health of merchant mariners in the 19th century.</p>
                     
                     <p><hi rend="bold">Disparate Care: The Navy and the Merchant Marine</hi> <persName ref="#END">Captain Doane's </persName>service 
                        as primary medical practitioner aboard 
                        the <name type="ship">Commonwealth</name> points to the varied accessibility to and quality 
                        of medical care available to sailors in the 19th century.  Nineteenth 
                        century medical treatment and practice for sailors was differentiated 
                        by employer affiliation: naval sailors received higher quality and more 
                        consistent health care than merchant marine sailors.  This was due in 
                        large part to the fact that naval sailors were responsible for protecting 
                        the nation, whereas merchant mariners were often employed on a case-by-case 
                        basis, one voyage at a time.  Contemporary physician <persName ref="#GB">Gilbert Blane</persName> explains: 
                        "Money would avail nothing to the public defence without a sufficient number 
                        of able and healthy men, which are the real resources of a state, and the true 
                        sinews of war" <bibl><ref target="#Observations"><persName ref="#CL">Lloyd</persName> 151</ref></bibl>.  In contrast to views of naval sailors as the 
                        "true sinews of war," mercantile mariners were seen as replaceable and therefore 
                        commercial ship owners experienced less economic and moral pressure to maintain 
                        quality healthcare on board their ships.  In his examination of 19th century 
                        British merchant ships, <persName ref="#GCC">G.C. Cook</persName> highlights the perceived expendability of 
                        these sailors: "merchant seamen…lived a most erratic existence—often being 
                        employed (frequently by ship owners who were often unscrupulous) for a 
                        single voyage only" <bibl><ref target="#ScurvyBrit">225</ref></bibl>.</p>
                     
                     <p><hi rend="bold">Medical Care on the <name type="ship">Commonwealth</name></hi>
                        This attitude of expendability that informed the treatment of mercantile sailors’ health is
                        documented in <persName ref="#LAD">Doane’s</persName> journal as well and represents a significant 
                        characterization of the relationship between <persName ref="#END">Captain Doane</persName> and the sailors 
                        in his charge.  The importance of their health and the seriousness of their 
                        illness is downplayed significantly in two instances, on <date when="1852-10-14">October 14</date> and <date when="1852-08-24">August 24</date>, 
                        1852, respectively, wherein <persName ref="#LAD">Doane</persName> reports 
                        that <persName ref="#END">Captain Doane</persName> believes sailors are "making believe" that they are ill 
                        or "fained [sic] sick."  However, even when actual illness is acknowledged 
                        and treated by <persName ref="#END">Captain Doane</persName>, concern for the sailor’s wellbeing is seen 
                        second to his ability to perform the duties for which he has been hired.</p>
                     
                     <p>A series of episodes on board the <name type="ship">Commonwealth</name> illustrates both 
                        the uncertainty of diagnosis and the unequal administration of medical 
                        aid.  Early on in the voyage to <placeName>Peru</placeName>, <persName ref="#LAD">Doane</persName> mentions <rs ref="#LAD">her</rs> <rs ref="#END">father</rs> 
                        administering treatment to a cat having a fit.  In <rs ref="#LAD">her</rs> <date when="1852-08-26">August 26, 1852</date> 
                        entry <persName ref="#LAD">Doane</persName> writes that after the administration of ether, the cat was 
                        "playing around as common."  On the other hand, when a sailor has a fit 
                        <persName ref="#LAD">Doane</persName> writes about it in <rs ref="#LAD">her</rs> <date when="1852-12-28">December 28, 1852</date> entry without mentioning 
                        any treatment given to him, merely saying "[he] soon came out of it" but 
                        noting that the next day "his eyes are very wild."</p>  
                     
                     <p>
                        While <persName ref="#LAD">Doane's</persName> concern for the health of <rs ref="#LAD">her</rs> kittens 
                        during this voyage might help explain <rs ref="#LAD">her</rs> more vague 
                        references to the treatment of the sailor, it could 
                        also be seen as reflecting the ways in which merchant 
                        sailors were not shown much concern, especially since 
                        fits were considered very serious in the 19th century.  
                        <persName ref="#JE">James Ewell</persName>, in <title level="m">The Planter's and Mariner's Medical 
                           Companion</title>, notes that there are four kinds of fits: 
                        apoplectic, epileptic, fainting, and hysteric.  
                        Fainting and hysteric fits were largely the province 
                        of women, and <persName ref="#JE">Ewell</persName> discusses apoplectic and epileptic

                        had the chills upon him."  The <persName ref="#END #ATD">Doanes'</persName> response 
                        is to take the sailor's pulse and then reassure 
                        him that it is strong and he has little to worry 
                        about.  <persName ref="#HL">Harold Langley</persName>, in a study of the early 
                        U.S. Navy, notes that the pulse was considered 
                        an indicator of health and that "If the pulse 
                        was slow or weak, the doctor concluded that 
                        the vascular fibers were weak or lax.  If the 
                        pulse was fast, the physician deduced that the 
                        vascular fibers were hyperactive and that fever 
                        was present, for hyperactivity produced heat" <bibl><ref target="#HistoryMed">31</ref></bibl>.  
                        A strong pulse, therefore, would be indicative of
                        health.  The medicine which <persName ref="#LAD">Doane</persName> says <rs ref="#LAD">her</rs> <rs ref="#ATD #END">parents</rs>

                        that it was a purgative&#x2014;either a laxative or an emetic&#x2014;since 
                        purging was considered to be the first course of 
                        treatment when fevers were feared <bibl><ref target="#PlantersMariners"><persName ref="#JE">Ewell</persName> 25</ref></bibl>, and, as 
                        <persName ref="#HL">Langley</persName> notes, cathartics (laxatives) and emetics were 
                        among three of the most commonly-prescribed treatments

                        Following the documentation of the sailor’s fear of 
                        Panama Fever and the administration of the medicine, 
                        <persName ref="#LAD">Doane</persName> notes in the next day's entry that the sailor's 
                        health is greatly improved and that he has returned to 
                        his work, which illustrates that the main purpose of 
                        administering medical care to any sailor on board would 
                        be to make him fit for duty as quickly as possible.  
                        Providing medicine to sailors on board merchant vessels, as we can 
                        see from this episode, depends largely on the needs 
                        and judgment of the captain of the ship, who is invested 
                        more in maintaining their required work regimen by dosing 
                        sick sailors with medicines perceived to be generally effective 
                        than in diagnosing and treating them with care and precision.

                        permanently disabled by shipboard accidents or who returned to

                        medical attention abroad <bibl><ref target="#HistoryMed"><persName ref="#HL">Langley</persName> 3</ref></bibl>.  As a result, the care 
                        that individuals received on land was significantly superior 
                        in quality to that which they received at sea.

                     <p>
                        <persName ref="#LAD">Doane</persName> frequently records what she eats and
                        cooks at sea, and she includes stories about various livestock kept on
                        board. These notations in her journal signal to us as contemporary readers
                        that food and diet are central concerns for crew and passengers. In fact,
                        <persName ref="#LAD">Doane's</persName> account suggests that food and
                        diet are connected to all kinds of other social interactions on board,
                        including social hierarchies, ship discipline, hospitality between ships, and
                        general health concerns. This preoccupation with food makes sense given that
                        while out to sea those on board only had access to food stocked on
                        the ship or food given to them by other ships they met at sea.  With limited
                        resources, the risk of spoiling or damage to food, and both sailors and
                        passengers to feed, food becomes bound up with the social lives of those on
                        board in several interesting ways. </p>
                     <p> The kinds of foods <persName ref="#LAD"
                        >Doane</persName> eats on board seem consistent with other accounts of
                        the foods ships generally took with them to sea. In his account of life on
                        merchant ships, <persName ref="#FTB">Frank Thomas Bullen</persName> writes
                        that American ships often had the best food stocks compared to other
                        countries <bibl><ref target="#MMS">214</ref></bibl>. According to his
                        experiences sailing in the mid to late 1800s, American ships generally kept
                        potatoes, onions, flour, dried apples, and cranberries in addition to the
                        usual staples of salt beef and pork, bread, rice, and pea soup <bibl><ref
                           target="#MMS">214</ref></bibl>. This variety is important because
                        ships that carried fewer vegetables often struggled with bouts of illness,
                        particularly scurvy. <persName ref="#LAD">Doane</persName> mentions eating
                        plenty of salted meats, but she also records eating pancakes and potatoes,
                        making fruit jelly, trading fruit cake with one ship, and receiving oranges,
                        onions, and pumpkins from another ship. She notes that they carry pigs and
                        chickens on board to kill and eat in addition to the stocked cured meat.
                        This variety of food is probably related to her social position on board,
                        but it demonstrates the kinds of foods ships comfortably could sail with.
                        Her <persName ref="#ATD">mother's</persName> birthday celebration provides a
                        case in point: for the dinner they feast on boiled beef, pork, potatoes,
                        prunes, wine, lemonade, plum pudding, and pumpkin pie. Even the sailors
                        receive wine and cake for this special celebration. </p>
                     <p>
                        <persName ref="#LAD">Doane's</persName> journal also shows the ways in which
                        food could function as both a privilege or a means of disciplining the
                        sailors. In her book <title level="m">Food in the United States</title>,
                        historian <persName ref="#SW">Susan Williams</persName> has chronicled the
                        ways in which food increasingly became associated with social status during
                        the 19th century. She writes, "For a rapidly growing American middle class,
                        the meal structure, food served, presentation, and dining rituals all
                        reinforced new standards of gentility" <bibl><ref target="#FUS"
                           >153</ref></bibl>. On board, we can see this relationship between social
                        status and dining in several ways. At one point, the Doane family allows the
                        carpenter, who is not usually invited to eat with them because he is a
                        "foreigner" of unknown origins, to eat with them in the cabin. <persName
                           ref="#LAD">Doane</persName> later finds out that the carpenter felt
                        embarrassed not only to be eating with them, but also to be eating while her
                        <persName ref="#ATD">mother</persName> sat at the table.</p> 
                     <p> On other occassions, <persName ref="#LAD"
                        >Doane</persName> witnesses sailors being denied food for 'misbehaving'.
                        For example, on March 3rd, one sailor asks the captain if he thinks that the
                        ration of potatoes given to the crew is enough for six men. The captain
                        responds by taking away all their potatoes as punishment for complaining
                        about their fare. Sources from around the time period suggest that depriving
                        sailors of food was not necessarily considered an appropriate means of
                        punishing them. In his 1879 edition of <title level="m">The seaman's
                           friend</title>, <persName ref="#RHDJ">R. H. Dana Jr.</persName> asserts
                        that all crew members have a right to food, and under no occassion should
                        the ship's master deny sailors this right <bibl><ref target="#SF"
                           >209</ref></bibl>. In fact, <persName ref="#RHDJ">Dana</persName>
                        suggests that sailors could technically win money in court if they proved
                        they had been denied food. That we see sailors denied basic food like
                        potatoes suggests that while at sea such rules were not always followed. But
                        <persName ref="#LAD">Doane</persName>, as a captain's daughter, appears
                        to have eaten very well and had access to a variety of food and cooking
                        supplies.</p>

                        <persName ref="#LAD">Doane</persName>'s journal fits many of the conventions

                           >Druett</persName>'s work describe. Though most primary source documents
                        are the writings of captain's wives, not captain's daughters, though it has
                        been estimated that "hundreds of children were raised on board ship"
                        <bibl><ref target="#Druett"><title level="m">Hen Frigates</title>
                           90</ref></bibl>, they still provide helpful context for a young
                        woman's life at sea. Personal diaries are often gendered as female, and in
                        the Victorian period, the diary genre enjoyed the distinction of being the
                        "preeminent form of written expression among women" <bibl><ref
                           target="#Springer">Springer, 94</ref></bibl>. Yet, the female-written
                        sea journal is also somewhat of a hybrid form, as these diarists would often
                        include elements specific to a ship's log, a type of writing "normally the
                        province of men," specifically male sea captains <bibl><ref

                        to what specific purpose (if any) <persName ref="#LAD">Louisa
                           Doane</persName> kept her journal, from noting that she included latitude
                        and longitude coordinates, carefully cited occasions for the raising and
                        lowering of sails, and carefully noted wind and weather conditions in her
                        entries, we are able to conjecture that she was simultaneously in the
                        practice of learning the craft of captaining a merchant vessel. </p>
                     <p>This sort of shipboard education was not

                        York with her husband to sail to San Francisco. On a previous voyage, she
                        was "taught about the winds and tides," and her husband "showed her how to
                        calculate the ship's position with the aid of the sextant and the
                        chronometer, how to work out the correct course to steer, and how to keep a

                        they broke with maritime tradition and went to sea, [captain's wives] found
                        their lives more closely approximating the prescribed strictures of separate

                     <p> Though often stimulating, life aboard a

                        crew, but would generally be on formal speaking terms with only the "mates,
                        steward, cook, and cabin boy" (95). This seems to be the case in the encoded
                        sections of the journal, but even these class divisions did not exempt Doane
                        from being exposed to power struggles aboard the ship. According to
                        Falconer's, one late-eighteenth century seafarer's dictionary, the role of a

                        willing to obey orders, a punishment which is doled out to another sailor on

                        involved in a confrontation with the cabin boy on October 14, when he is

                        continues with his transgressions, and goes on "talking very saucy to

                     <p>During their time in <placeName ref="#Marseille">Marseille</placeName>, 
                        <persName ref="#LAD">Doane</persName>
                        and her parents chose to stay at an American hotel. Writing for the <title level="m">
                           The Western Monthly </title>in 1869, Joseph Kirkland was quick to criticize such
                        institutions, arguing that, <q>"to go to an American hotel abroad, and otherwise
                           to herd with one's own fellow countrymen, is a confession of homesickness and of
                           regret for having left home at all. The place to see Americans is America. In
                           foreign lands the true sight to be seen is <q>'These Foreigners'</q>" </q>(248).
                        <persName ref="#LAD">Doane</persName>, however, did not share his 
                        contempt. She notes that the landlady, though
                        French, had happily, <q>"been in New York a number of years and could speak very 
                           good <sic>english</sic>" </q>and is delighted
                        to find that friends of their's, a <persName ref="#Eliott">Captain Eliott </persName>
                        and his family, are also staying at the hotel (1 April
                        1852). Again, <persName ref="#LAD">Doane</persName>'s 
                        warm enthusiasm seems to suggest some relief at once 
                        more finding herself amongst familiar company, and perhaps recalls an earlier occasion
                        at sea when she wistfully observes women on-board a passing ship: <q>"we saw there
                           were two ladies on board, which was quite a party <sic>to to </sic>us,

                     <p>Whether or not <persName ref="#LAD">Doane</persName> 
                        did think of herself as a young holiday-maker in France,
                        her time in <placeName ref="#Marseille">Marseille </placeName>seems to be have been
                        as much practically spent as it was leisurely. She records details of a number of
                        visits to the dentist, and refers to a shopping trip, both of which, after so long at sea,
                        must have been all too necessary. The imminence of their departure must surely have 
                        been ever-present in <persName ref="#LAD">Doane</persName>'s 
                        mind, and might be imagined to have had some influence
                        over the way in which she spent her days in <placeName ref="#Marseille">Marseille
                        </placeName>. Certainly, in addition to her more practical excursions, 
                        <persName ref="#LAD">Doane</persName> seems 
                        to have been keen to make the most of her time abroad, and her journal entries 
                        describe trips around <placeName ref="#Marseille">Marseille </placeName>and the 
                        local culture. Although she rarely refers to sites that she visited by name, the 
                        details she gives suggest that she visited both the Abbaye Saint-Victor and the
                        Porte D'Aix, in addition to making frequent trips around the city on foot and 
                        horseback.</p>
                     <p>Had she consulted the various contemporary guidebooks available to American 
                        tourists however, and whether or not she did is, of course, difficult to know, 
                        she may have been disappointed. <title level="m">A Satchel Guide for the Vacation
                           Tourist</title>, published in 1924, dedicates barely more than half a page to 
                        <placeName ref="#Marseille">Marseille</placeName>, while John Murray's 
                        <title level="m">A Handbook for Travellers in France </title>(1867) and 
                        <title level="m">Norton's Hand-Book to Europe; or, How to Travel in the Old World 
                        </title>(1860) have little in the way of praise to offer France's biggest sea-port.
                        Indeed, writing in the <title level="m">Norton's Hand-Book</title>, J. H. Siddons
                        warns his readers that <placeName ref="#Marseille">Marseille </placeName><q>"has
                           all the disagreeable features of an ordinary sea-port town, and some very offensive
                           ones which are peculiarly its own," </q>and advises that they <q>"regulate [their]
                              arrival at <placeName ref="#Marseille">Marseille </placeName>that the place may
                              be immediately quitted for Malta and Alexandria" <bibl><ref target="#Siddons">
                                 (167)</ref></bibl>. </q>That is about the full extent of his observations about
                        <persName ref="#LAD">Doane</persName>'s destination. Murray goes into more 
                        detail, but is hardly any more positive.
                        The port he describes as the <q>"sewer of the city"</q>, the old town as <q>
                           "scarcely worth entering" <bibl><ref target="#Murray">(476)</ref></bibl></q>, 
                        and his account of the artwork displayed in various council buildings is no less
                        scathing: <q>"The subjects are all horrible"</q>, he notes, <q>"and the execution 
                           not good enough to compensate" <bibl><ref target="#Murray">(467)</ref></bibl></q>.
                     </p>
                     <p>If <persName ref="#LAD">Doane</persName> found any of this to be true, she 
                        gives no indication of it in her
                        journal, and the delight with which she records the details of her dinners and 
                        suppers, her various expeditions and walks through the city, and the warmth with 
                        which she describes the friends that she met there, suggest that her stay in 
                        <placeName ref="#Marseille">Marseille </placeName>was, in spite of the guidebooks,
                        quite pleasant. Perhaps
                        she, unlike Murray, Siddons, and Rolfe, had an appreciation for the sea-port town
                        that came with her maritime experience, or perhaps simply from having arrived after 
                        a very long 54 days at sea.</p>

                           Vessel</emph></p>  
                     <p>The voyages Louisa Doane's father,
                           <persName ref="END">Captain Edmund Doane</persName>, undertook were
                        primarily in the service of larger merchants and other industries. As
                        captain of a merchant vessel, <rs type="person" ref="END">Captain
                           Doane's</rs> daily routine involved an absolute awareness and intricate
                        negotiation of responsibility for the temporary ownership of the ship's
                        cargo. <title level="m">The American Ship-Master's Daily Assistant</title>,
                        an 1807 guide to maritime law, clearly suggests that the primary concern for
                        the master of any vessel was his responsibility for the ship's cargo
                              <bibl><ref target="ASMDA"><title level="m">The American Ship-Master's
                                 Daily Assistant</title> 1</ref></bibl>. According to maritime laws,
                        the master of the vessel remained responsible for all damages occurring to
                        cargo once aboard. The only exceptions to these laws were any damages
                        attributed to "an act of God" and theft by piracy at sea. Any damage
                        occurring due to poor ship maintenance (water damage for example), theft
                        occurring while at port, damage by the crew or sailors, and even damage by
                        rats was deemed the legal responsibility of the captain. This principle of
                        responsibility significantly shapes life onboard including issues of
                        discipline and the emphasis <persName ref="LAD">Louisa Doane</persName>
                        gives to the animal life onboard.</p>
                     <p>Although the owners of the ship were
                        responsible for the cost of any damages needing attention that were not the
                        fault of the captain or crew, the captain was required to pull into a port
                        as soon as possible once damage detrimental to the ship and ship's cargo
                        occurred. When questioned, the master of the vessel had to be able immediate
                        response to be the case, making ship's logs extremely important. Any damage
                        occurring while at sea was to be declared immediately upon the arrival of
                        the vessel into port. Often, damage attributed to "acts of God" would
                        require confirmation by multiple sources. These sources included not only
                        official documents like the captain's log and ship manifests, but also
                        testimonies by crew members or passengers. Not only does the captain's
                        responsibility for the cargo explain <persName ref="LAD">Louisa

                        documentation of agents embarkation and debarkation while at port in

                     <p>The decade of the clipper ship domination
                        saw an expansion of commercial interests that <persName ref="LAD">Louisa
                           Doane</persName>'s journal was clearly a part of. Although readers see
                           <rs type="person" ref="END">Doane</rs>'s ship stopping at various ports
                        for different exchanges, one of the most fascinating episodes includes their
                        trip to obtain guano from <rs type="place" ref="LobosIslands">islands of the
                           coast of Peru </rs>. The guano industry in the mid-nineteenth century
                        marks a unique period in the development of international commercial
                        interests, with some scholars declaring the guano industry and the 1856
                           <title level="a">Guano Act</title> to be the first clear attempt by the
                        United States to secure international commercial resources through

                        suggests that early in the 1850's, the market developed so quickly that a
                        clear public knowledge of what the product was or what it was to be used for
                        was not entirely clear.</p>
                     <p>Despite the impetus to proceed with caution
                        to preserve precious cargo like the guano obtained from the <placeName

                        transportaion industry, each with particular attachments to developments in
                        merchant vessels. The specific companies operating in the background of
                        Doane's journeys include the merchant company <orgName ref="HowAsp">Howland
                           and Aspinwall</orgName> who chartered part of their voyage, and the
                        paternrship of <orgName ref="FN">Foster's and Nickerson</orgName> who were
                        partial owners of the <name type="ship">Commonwealth</name>. <orgName
                           ref="HowAsp">Howland and Aspinwall</orgName> was a prestigious firm at
                        the forefront of transportation developments in the mid-nineteenth century.
                        The firm is credited with funding the construction of innovative streamlined
                        ship designs like the <name type="ship">Sea Witch</name> that travelled
                        from <placeName ref="NYC">New York</placeName> to China in a record
                        seventy-nine days in 1849. Shipbuilding and merchant companies like the
                        parternship created by <orgName ref="FN">Foster and Nickerson</orgName> were
                        not only deeply involved in this boom of shipbuilding, but were also
                        particularly invested in the speed of ships rounding <placeName ref="CHorn"
                           >Cape Horn</placeName>. Records set by ships such as the <name

                        commercial interests, but created a shipbuilding market driven by a desire
                        for faster transportation. The partnership between <orgName ref="FN">Foster
                           and Nickerson</orgName> began, and continued with the desrire to charter
                        faster ships around <placeName ref="CHorn">Cape Horn</placeName>. This
                        shared desire for faster transportation not only paved the way for what the
                           <title level="m">American National Biography</title> defined as a "decade

                        competitive drive between captains, evidenced by what became known as the

                        1852. Although the Doanes' journey around the <rs type="place" ref="CHorn"
                           >Cape</rs> was not solely to transport goods from <placeName ref="NYC"

                        like most ships involved in the race, this competitive drive can be felt in

                        around <placeName ref="#CHorn">Cape Horn</placeName> was the only way to “efficiently” move goods and people from Atlantic to
                        Pacific. There was no naturally occurring break between North and South America, from the

                        sailed all the way around the tip of South America to reach the other side of North America.

                     <p>Particularly in the immediate aftermath of the gold rush, the Drake Passage became a

                        journey, added more traffic to the sea. Dangerous and uncomfortable as it was, merchant
                        marines, passenger ships, and those who longed to move to California, during and after the
                        gold rush, made the journey round the <placeName ref="CHorn">Horn</placeName>. </p>

                        South America. It marks the northern boundary of the Drake Passage, the 600 mile stretch of ocean
                        between the rocky island and Antarctica, which is commonly considered the stormiest portion
                        of ocean in the world.</p>

                     <p>The dangers and discomfort of the journey have been thoroughly documented. Two other journals

                        <placeName ref="#CHorn">Cape Horn</placeName>. Rounding the <placeName ref="#CHorn">Horn</placeName>, the vagaries of wind and weather and the amount of human
                        misery caused by both, figures prominently in both. <persName ref="#LAD">Doane</persName>, who made her journey in the same
                        year, certainly acknowledges some of the hardships. </p>
                     
                     <p>But while <bibl><ref target="#VoyageCalifornia">Kendall</ref></bibl> uses hyperbolic terms to describe her experience and <bibl><ref target="RoundHorn">Samson</ref></bibl> titled his book
                        after that particular landmark, <persName ref="#LAD">Doane</persName> acknowledges it with
                        a simple, evocative phrase in her November 1 entry: “the long dreaded Place.” Her
                        descriptions of the sailors’ efforts to keep the ship safe are matter of fact about wild
                        water and wind. They adjust their sails before the wind, and try to cope with rolling seas.
                        For example on Nov 8, she describes the night: “a heavy Squall came and the
                        wind blowing a Huricane […] The wind howling through the rigging and the waves running high
                        and washing over us continually the vessel diving into the sea very deep.”</p>
                     
                     <p>Her even-handed account of a place that had (by then) acquired a reputation for savagery is
                        a valuable addition to the resource of familiar papers. <placeName ref="#CHorn">Cape Horn</placeName>
                        occupied a romantic place in the popular imagination of
                        mid-nineteenth-century Americans—it was viewed as the end of the Earth. Other discourses are
                        dominated by the discovery of “naked natives” and the deaths of missionaries who came to
                        convert the Yahgon. <persName ref="#LAD">Doane</persName> does not dwell on these discourses; her writing focuses on the
                        height of the waves and the situation it creates for sailors without mittens. </p>

            <p> This edition is the latest in a series of collaboratively produced electronic
               editions of previously unpublished nineteenth-century American manuscripts held in
               the Rare Books and Manuscripts Library at The Ohio State University. Previous
               editions include "My Dear Elizabeth," five letters written by Sophia Peabody
               Hawthorne to her sister Elizabeth Palmer Peabody between ca. 1837 and 1868 (currently
               being revised), "Dear Wife," twenty-one letters written by riverboat captain
               William B. Anderson to his wife Louisa while he plied the Ohio river during the
               height of the American Civil War, 1862–1864, and "Journal of a Tour to Europe," by
               Samuel Sullivan Cox. These documentary editions are intended
               to provide wide exposure and access to manuscripts that might otherwise be difficult
               for scholars to discover and consult, and to provide users with a variety of tools
               for studying those texts. </p>
            <p> Each text was edited in connection with an undergraduate or graduate course offered
               by H. Lewis Ulman, Associate Professor of English at The Ohio State University. The
               courses aim to provide students with an opportunity to explore issues of textuality
               and mediation that arise when our cultural archives spread from page to screen and
               from library shelves to networked databases. Electronic textual editing is our
               vehicle for examining what happens—and envisioning what might happen—when artifacts
               in one medium are represented in another medium, especially with regard to the
               interpretive work of reading. Electronic textual editions also provide a contact zone
               that can help us reflect on what manuscript, print, and "born digital" artifacts can
               tell us about their unique properties and their relationships to one another.</p>
            <p> While providing a reliable textual edition is a <foreign xml:lang="lat">sine qua
                  non</foreign>, the Doane edition also explores ways of telling four stories
               inextricably woven into our work: the lives and historical milieu evoked by the
               texts, the history of the physical journal (including its recent restoration), the
               editorial process that gave rise to this particular interpretation of the text, and
               the mediation of our electronic delivery system. </p>

               images at 400 dots per inch (dpi), then coverted to 8-bit JPEG images at 400 dpi and
               full quality before being loaded into the Media Manager application. All edges were
               overscanned by at least 1/4 inch. No color correction was used at any stage of image
               preparation, but a scan of a photographer's 18% grey card on the same scanner
               produced RGB values at the center of 91/95/107 after applying a 150% Gaussian Blur in
               Adobe Photoshop to average color values. Thus, a properly configured monitor should
               provide a reasonable approximation of colors on the manuscript pages.

               <emph rend="bold">Markup of Physical Structure and Page Layout</emph>. The manuscript
                  <emph rend="bold">pages</emph>, encoded by the empty page break or &lt;pb/&gt;
               element, are the primary physical structures represented in the markup. Each
               &lt;pb&gt; element includes an &quot;mmid&quot; attribute identifying the unique ID
               of a high-resolution scan of that image in the Media Manager application, as well as
               &quot;audiostart&quot; and &quot;audioend&quot; attributes that identify the section
               of the audio edition that corresponds to that page. <emph rend="bold">Line
                  breaks</emph> (i.e., lineation determined or influenced by the physical
               constraints of the page rather than compositional choices by the author) are encoded
               with the empty &lt;lb/&gt; element. No attributes are included in the &lt;lb&gt;

                  entry</emph>, encoded by a &lt;div1&gt; element with the attribute-value pair
               &quot;type='Entry'&quot;, constitutes the primary textual structure represented in
               the markup. Each entry contains an &lt;opener&gt; element—which in turn contains a
               &lt;dateline&gt; element—and one or more paragraphs. Each dateline may include a
               &lt;name&gt; element with (optionally) a &quot;type&quot; attribute containing one of
               the following values: city, region; and a &lt;date&gt; element with a
               &quot;value&quot; attribute whose value is in the form YYYY-MM-DD. The &lt;div1&gt;
               elements also contain &quot;audiostart&quot; and &quot;audioend&quot; elements that
               identify the section of the audio edition that corresponds to that entry. </p>
            <p>Entries consist of a series of <emph rend="bold">paragraphs</emph>. Where indicated
               by indentation of a line from the left margin of a page, line breaks part-way across
               a page, or additional white space between lines, paragraphs are encoded with the
               &lt;p&gt; element and no attributes. </p>
            <p>If present, any prefatory text preceding the dateline may be encoded as a
               &lt;head&gt; element at the beginning of the entry (i.e., within the
               &lt;div&gt;element and before the &lt;opener&gt;). </p>

               The basic transcription follows the manuscript verbatim. Various manuscript features
               (e.g., cancellations, interlinear or marginal additions, tears in pages) are encoded,

                     and lemons to the man suffering from scurvy is indicative of the larger debate about the causes and prevention of scurvy in the mid-19th century.  
                     Although it was widely accepted that lime and other citrus juices were preventive agents, sailors were said to be reluctant to drink the juice.  
                     A series of letters to the editor in an 1866 publication of the London Times reveals the alternative preventives proposed by many doctors; significantly,
                     "fresh succulent vegetables" as well as potatoes and "preserved potatoes" were thought to be a successful alternative 
                     that presented an easier pill for sailors to swallow. (<bibl><ref target="#Scurvy">"Scurvy"</ref></bibl>)
