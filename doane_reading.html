               This morning when I arose I found
               the weather quite good and quite smooth so I
               sat down and went
               to work on some fancy work but
               did not remain so long before the wind came
               ahead and made it very ruffrough
               yesterday I was                
               seasick and unable to write,

               within her course, It has begun to cloud up, I think
               we shall have some rain soon, We have two cats on
               board, and they were quite wild so we put them
               down in the hole, they have come out today for the

               said I had one tooth that

               kill the nerve so they would never trouble me,
               he then put in the stuff which kills the nerves.
               and said I must let it be <span class="sic">untill [sic]</span>tomorrow, when I

A series of letters to the editor in an 1866 publication of the London Times reveals the alternative preventives proposed by many doctors; significantly, &#34;fresh succulent vegetables&#34; as well as potatoes and &#34;preserved potatoes&#34; were thought to be a successful alternative that presented an easier pill for sailors to swallow.

               hands were called to take in sail as
               it was blowing fresh It was nearly
               half an hour before the first Officer came
               on deck and when he did he went to
               schooling one of the sailor for nothing
               at all father stepped up and asked
               him what he was abusing that sailor
               
               
               for he said he was not. Father told him
               the sailor came when he was called and
               that was more than he did. he gave Father
               a very saucy reply and from that it <span class="sic">lead[sic]</span> on
               to a long talk and almost came to blows
               Mother and myselfemyself ran out on deck
               very much <span class="sic">frieghten[sic]</span>. I never heard a
               man talk so insulting he told Fathe[r]  he
               should try to get along untilluntil we got in
               then he should make <span class="sic">Fathe[sic]</span> all the troub he could, he also said if <span class="sic">mothe[sic]</span> had
               not been on board she would have been
               a widow which was as much to say he
               would have killed Father. He says he
               will kill the  [C?] ook when he gets in He

               a baby one month old it was in a box with
               some ropes put across the bottom and a mat
               lay it on and there the baby layedlaid hung to

Pilot Bread is also described in terms of seafaring in the Appletons' Journal of Literature, Science and Art, on January 14 of 1871. In a seemingly fictional story entitled &#34;At Sea&#34; by A.

            Doane's entry, with its references to the harbor's <q>"beautiful entrance," </q>and views of the city, is very unlike
            Murray's description. Commenting on the layout of the city, rising on hills around
            the port, he says the following:
            <q>"From this disposition of the ground, the port becomes the sewer of the city, the
               receptacle of all its
               filth, stagnating in a tideless sea and under a burning sun, until a S. E. wind produces
               that circulation in its
               waters which the tide would do on other seas. The stench emanating from it at times
               is consequently intolerable, except
               for natives; and dredging machines require to be constantly employed to cleanse it"(
               (476)).</q><a href="#pMH" class="annotation">

         <p class="hang15"><a name="nConsigne"></a>5.&nbsp;Murray provides this information: <q>"near the harbour mouth, is the 
               Consigne, or health office, where every thing relating to quarantine is transacted, and whence
               the permission
               for vessels to enter the harbour is issued. To this office the captains of vessels
               come to give an account of themselves
               (raisoner), and to show their bill of health. The council room contains a few paintings,
               chiefly having reference to the plague [. . .] The subjects are all horrible, and
               the execution not good enough to 
               compensate</q> (477).<a href="#pConsigne" class="annotation">

            criticism of American hotels, it seems hardly surprising that Doane's family chose

            the causes and prevention of scurvy in the mid-19th century.  
            Although it was widely accepted that lime and other citrus juices were preventive
            agents, sailors were said to be reluctant to drink the juice.  
            A series of letters to the editor in an 1866 publication of the London Times reveals
            the alternative preventives proposed by many doctors; significantly,
            "fresh succulent vegetables" as well as potatoes and "preserved potatoes" were thought
            to be a successful alternative 
            that presented an easier pill for sailors to swallow. (("Scurvy"))

            cocoa-nuts--coral reefs--tatooed chiefs..."(3)
            Though the islands were beautiful and exotic, people of the 19th century feared them.
            "Within the last few years American and English vessels engaged in the extensive whale
            fisheries of the Pacific
            have...put into the commodious harbor which there is in one of the islands; but a
            fear of the natives, founded on the recollection of the dreadful fate which many white
            men have received at their hands,
            has deterred their crews from intermixing with the population sufficiently to gain
            any insight in their peculiar customs and manners"(4).
            In his narrative, Melville hoped to discover more about the Marquesas in order to
            "withdraw the veil from regions so romantic and beautiful"(4) [<a href="http://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/2005692073/" alt="Map of Islands in Herman Melville's narrative" target="_blank">19th Century Map</a>].

            "Snedicor

            to carry profitable cargo at much higher speeds than older ships. With this new kind

         <h2>About this View of the Journal</h2>
         <hr>
         <p><a name="view"></a> This presentation of the Dane journal derives from the project's
            main XML file, Doane-Journal.xml, transformed with Doane_view_common.xsl and
            Doane_view_reading.xsl. In this "view" of the Doane journal, the text of the journal
            is
            organized by daily entries. The single horizontal line between daily entries has been
            added to
            the text to aid scanning the text; it does not appear in the manuscript. Line breaks
            in the
            manuscript are not reported; rather, lines wrap in the browser's window. Page breaks
            are not
            reported. Paragraph breaks follow those in the manuscript. Spelling, punctuation,
            capitalization, and abbreviations are reported as they appear in the manuscript. Text
            highlighted by Doane with an underscore is underscored in this view. Text canceled
            by Doane is
            suppressed. Text added by Doane between lines or in the margins is silently incorporated
            into
            the text. All material added by the editor is surrounded by square brackets: uncertain
            readings are enclosed in square brackets and followed by a question mark, and text
            supplied by
            the editor for clarity is set in italics and surrounded by square brackets. Gaps in
            the
            manuscript (e.g., from tears) are indicated by elipses enclosed by square brackets.
            Links to
