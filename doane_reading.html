               Mr Brown talking singing and laughing I knew He
               was drunk. The 
               
               
               Mate came off with them His name is Bailey

            entrance," and views of the city, is very unlike John Murray's description
            fifteen years later in <cite>A Handbook for Travellers in
               France</cite> (1867). Commenting on the layout of the city, rising on hills
            around the port, he says the following: "From this disposition of the ground,
            the port becomes the sewer of the city, the receptacle of all its filth,
            stagnating in a tideless sea and under a burning sun, until a S. E. wind
            produces that circulation in its waters which the tide would do on other seas.
            The stench emanating from it at times is consequently intolerable, except for
            natives; and dredging machines require to be constantly employed to cleanse it"
            (476).<a href="#pMH" class="annotation">
               [Back]
               </a></p>
         <p class="hang15"><a id="nConsigne"></a>6.&nbsp;Murray's <cite>Handbook</cite>
            provides this information: "near the harbour mouth, is the  Consigne, or health office, where every thing
            relating to quarantine is transacted, and whence the permission for vessels to
            enter the harbour is issued. To this office the captains of vessels come to
            give an account of themselves (raisoner), and
            to show their bill of health. The council room contains a few paintings,
            chiefly having reference to the plague.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The subjects are all horrible,
            and the execution not good enough to compensate (477).<a href="#pConsigne" class="annotation">
               [Back]
               </a></p>
         <p class="hang15"><a id="nAH"></a>7.&nbsp;It is hardly surprising that Doane's family chose to
            stay in a hotel catering specifically for Americans if they held beliefs such
            as those presented in Murray's <cite>A Handbook for Travellers in
               France </cite>: "The character of the people [in the Provence] appear
            influenced by the fiery sun, and soil which looks as though it never cooled.
            Their fervid temperament knows no control or moderation; ferocious in
            disposition, they are led by very slight religious or political excitement, on
            sudden impulses, to the committal of murders, assassinations, and other acts of
            violence unknown in the North" (430).<a href="#pAH" class="annotation">

               </a></p>
         <p class="hang15"><a id="nPA"></a>8.&nbsp;Probably the Porte d'Aix. Murray describes it thus:
            "The entrance from the side of Aix is by an Arch of
            Triumph, remarkable not for elegance of design, originality of
            elevation, or elegance of decoration. It was intended to commemorate the
            campaign of the French in Spain in 1823, but its destination is now changed to
            that of celebrating 'all the glories of France'" (476).<a href="#pPA" class="annotation">

         <p class="hang15"><a id="nPotLem"></a>9.&nbsp;That the Doanes provide both potatoes and lemons
            to the man suffering from scurvy is indicative of the larger debate in the
            mid-19th century about the causes and prevention of scurvy. Although it was
            widely accepted that lime and other citrus juices were preventive agents,
            sailors were said to be reluctant to drink the juice. A series of letters to
            the editor of the <cite>London Times</cite> in 1866 reveals the
            alternative preventives proposed by many doctors; significantly, "fresh
            succulent vegetables" as well as potatoes and "preserved potatoes" were thought
            to be a successful alternative that presented an easier pill for sailors to
            swallow (King)

            swelling caused by malarial infections. Manson describes in detail the effects
            of quinine on a patient: "I gave him twenty grains of quinine .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and next
            morning, on awaking, the pain had vanished, and the inflammation of the muscles
            of the jaw and general swelling of the face had diminished to such a degree
            that he could eat his breakfast" (41)

            American and English vessels engaged in the extensive whale fisheries of the
            Pacific have .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. put into the commodious harbor which there is in one of the
            islands; but a fear of the natives, founded on the recollection of the dreadful
            fate which many white men have received at their hands, has deterred their
            crews from intermixing with the population sufficiently to gain any insight in
            their peculiar customs and manners" (4). Melville hoped to discover more about the Marquesas in

            starch and less gluten than macaroni" (55). In a seemingly fictional story entitled "At Sea" by A. Jones,
            Pilot bread is used not only as a diet staple but also as a remedy for
            seasickness: "Now, if you will just nibble pilot's-bread for a day, and sip

            organized by daily entries. The single horizontal line between daily entries has been
            added to
            the text to aid scanning the text; it does not appear in the manuscript. Line breaks
            in the
            manuscript are not reported; rather, lines wrap in the browser's window. Page breaks
            are not
            reported. Paragraph breaks follow those in the manuscript. Spelling, punctuation,
            capitalization, and abbreviations are reported as they appear in the manuscript (see
            the
            Markup Guidelines appendix for more information about the treatment of Doane's orthography).
            Text highlighted by Doane with an underscore is underscored in this view. Text canceled
            by
            Doane is suppressed. Text added by Doane between lines or in the margins is silently
            incorporated into the text. All material added by the editor is surrounded by square
            brackets:
            uncertain readings are enclosed in square brackets and followed by a question mark,
            and text
            supplied by the editor for clarity is set in italics and surrounded by square brackets.
            Gaps
            in the manuscript (e.g., from tears or unrecoverable cancelations) are indicated by
            elipses
            enclosed by square brackets. Links to notes are colored and superscripted. </p>
