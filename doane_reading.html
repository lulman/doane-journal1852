         ahead and made it very ruff

         Doane's entry, with its references to the harbor's "beautiful entrance," and views of the city, is very unlike
         Murray's description. Commenting on the layout of the city, rising on hills around
         the port, he says the following:
         "From this disposition of the ground, the port becomes the sewer of the city, the
         receptacle of all its
         filth, stagnating in a tideless sea and under a burning sun, until a S. E. wind produces
         that circulation in its
         waters which the tide would do on other seas. The stench emanating from it at times
         is consequently intolerable, except
         for natives; and dredging machines require to be constantly employed to cleanse it"
         (
         (476))

            Consigne</em>, or health office, where every thing relating to quarantine is transacted, and whence
         the permission
         for vessels to enter the harbour is issued. To this office the captains of vessels
         come to give an account of themselves
         (<em>raisoner</em>), and to show their bill of health. The council room contains a few paintings,
         chiefly having reference to the plague [. . .] The subjects are all horrible, and

         criticism of American hotels, it seems hardly surprising that Doane's family chose
         to stay in a hotel catering specifically for Americans if beliefs such 
         as those presented in Murray's <cite>A Handbook for Travellers in France </cite>were prevalent: 
         "The character of the people [in the Provence] appear influenced by the fiery sun,
         and soil which looks as though
         it never cooled. Their fervid temperament knows no control or moderation; ferocious
         in disposition, they are led
         by very slight religious or political excitement, on sudden impulses, to the committal
         of murders, assassinations,
         and other acts of violence unknown in the North"

Murray describes it thus: "The entrance
         from the side of Aix is by an Arch of Triumph, remarkable not for elegance of design,
         originality of elevation, or elegance of decoration. It was intended to commemorate
         the campaign of the French
         in Spain in 1823, but its destination is now changed to that of celebrating 'all the glories of France'"

      <p class="hang15"><a name="PotLem"></a>8.&nbsp;That the Doanes provide both potatoes 
         and lemons to the man suffering from scurvy is indicative of the larger debate about
         the causes and prevention of scurvy in the mid-19th century.  
         Although it was widely accepted that lime and other citrus juices were preventive
         agents, sailors were said to be reluctant to drink the juice.  
         A series of letters to the editor in an 1866 publication of the London Times reveals
         the alternative preventives proposed by many doctors; significantly,
         "fresh succulent vegetables" as well as potatoes and "preserved potatoes" were thought
         to be a successful alternative 
         that presented an easier pill for sailors to swallow. (

         "decaying vegetation, stagnant water, and a high temperature" 
         (820)
         .  Buel further notes that the Panama Fever derives its name
         from the isthmus of Panama, which was supposed to be its place of origin, and that
         the fever usually developed
         around the time ships arrived at the port of Acapulco

         father seems to suggest that the man died from this treatment, rather than from the

         "fasting has a great power over diseases of this kind. We have cured many a case of
         bad dysentery at sea, depending principally upon entire abstinence from all food and

         a very detailed manner, so readers can get a sense of what the islands were like in
         Louisa Doane's time. Melville writes: "The Marquesas! What strange visions of outlandish

         cocoa-nuts--coral reefs--tatooed chiefs..."

         Though the islands were beautiful and exotic, people of the 19th century feared them.
         "Within the last few years American and English vessels engaged in the extensive whale
         fisheries of the Pacific
         have...put into the commodious harbor which there is in one of the islands; but a
         fear of the natives, founded on the recollection of the dreadful fate which many white
         men have received at their hands,
         has deterred their crews from intermixing with the population sufficiently to gain
         any insight in their peculiar customs and manners"
         (4)

         In his narrative, Melville hoped to discover more about the Marquesas in order to

         In the 19th century, Quinine was known to not only dispel fever, but it also cured
         pain and swelling caused from malarial infections. Manson describes in detail the
         effects of quinine on a patient:
         "I gave him twenty grains of quinine...and next morning, on awaking, the pain had
         vanished, and the inflammation of the muscles of the jaw

         pilot bread and plain crackers, those without 'shortening' of butter or lard, are
         simply 
         flour and water worked into a tough dough and baked instead of being air or sun dried

         Pilot bread is used not only as a diet staple but also as a remedy for seasickness.
         "Snedicor

      <p><strong>About this View of the Journal</strong></p>
      <p><a name="view"></a>The text of the journal is organized by daily entries. Line breaks in
         the manuscript are not reported; rather, lines wrap in the browser's window. Page
         breaks are not reported. Paragraph breaks follow those in the manuscript. Spelling,
         punctuation, capitalization, and abbreviations are reported as they appear in the
         manuscript. Text highlighted by Doane with an underscore is underscored in this view.
         Text canceled by Doane is suppressed. Text added by Doane between lines or in the
         margins
         is silently incorporated into the text. All material added by the editor is
         surrounded by square brackets: uncertain readings are enclosed in square brackets
         and
         followed by a question mark, and text supplied by the editor for clarity is set in
         italics and surrounded by square brackets. Gaps in the manuscript (e.g., from tears)
         are indicated by elipses enclosed by square brackets. Links to notes and external
         materials are colored and underlined. Finally, the background consists of a tiled
         detail from a page of Doane's journal.
