                     <p>Life at sea was plagued with violence
                        during the late 18th and 19th century, especially on ships carrying
                        captives. Prisoners on board ships were treated with little or no civility,
                        as clearly evidenced in Louisa Doane’s journal. On March 7th, 1852, <persName ref="#LAD">Louisa </persName>
                        describes an incident between <persName ref="#END">Captain Doane</persName>and his prisoners: <q rend="block">"The Prisoners
                           are singing at a great rate and disturbing us very much [.] When <rs ref="#END">Father</rs>
                           [ordered] them to stop which they did but gave him a very saucy reply, then
                           Father [ordered?] the Second Mate not to give them but half a bread apiece
                           for their suppers[.]" (lines 2133-2138)</q> This quote demonstrates how the
                        smallest indignation could result in the prisoners suffering often terrible
                        consequences; in this example, an insolent remark deprived them of food.
                        Those convicted of mutiny suffered even greater punishment. In a letter from
                        Admiral Pringle to Evan Nepean, Esquire, on November 27th, 1797, T. Pringle
                        describes in detail the repercussions of mutiny endured by those convicted.
                        Pringle describes that mutiny threw ships into “a state of tumult,” often
                        resulting in ship officers being sent ashore <bibl><ref target="#THL">Theal 207</ref></bibl>. When mutinous
                        sailors were captured, they “were condemned by a Court Martial” and either
                        sentenced to death or imprisonment (where chances of survival were slim due
                        to unclean conditions) <bibl><ref target="#THL">Theal 208</ref></bibl>. When mutineers were sentenced to death,
                        the execution took place only days later. Prisoners had no time to appeal
                        their penalties. </p>
                     <p>In Records of the Cape Colony from December
                        1796, sailors on the Rattlesnake attempted to give an explanation for their
                        mutinous thoughts by writing their grievances to His Majesty. Fifteen
                        sailors describe that they suffered oppression under the hands of “young and
                        inexperienced Officers” and that the Officers were men who “learned to
                        Command before they had learned obedience” <bibl><ref target="#THL">Theal 174</ref></bibl>. Their list of
                        complaints against their British officers is lengthy. First, they propose to
                        the king that the officers “shall not harass nor oppress the subjects of
                        Great Britain in any scandalous or Fraudulent manner,” causing readers to
                        believe that treatment by British officers was, at the time, indecent <bibl><ref target="#THL">Theal 175</ref></bibl>. The sailors also wish to have “Two Washing Days in the Week instead of
                        Two Hours” and wish “that sobriety be strictly observed” by the officers
                        <bibl><ref target="#THL">Theal 175</ref></bibl>. Instead of being treated like equal servants of the British
                        crown, sailors were heavily oppressed by officers and treated like slaves
                        (similar to how <persName ref="#END">Captain Doane</persName> treated his own ‘misbehaving’
                        sailors).</p>
                     <p>Towards the end of the 19th century, the US
                        Navy abolished the flogging of sailors aboard sea vessels. This was a widely
                        used tactic to control a ships crew along with any prisoners that may be
                        aboard. It is likely that <persName ref="#END">Captain Doane</persName> accepted this rule, as there is no
                        evidence of <persName ref="#LAD">Louisa Doane</persName> indicating her <rs ref="#END">father</rs> did so. The withholding of parts of
                        the prisoners meals is another sign that her <rs ref="#END">father</rs> either disapproved of
                        flogging or that he was abiding by the newly enacted law. One way the Navy
                        was proposing to preserve the safety aboard ships was to begin utilizing
                        Marine guards on sea-going vessels. “There can be no doubt as to the
                        necessity of an increased and efficient Marine guard on board our ships,
                        arising out of the abolition of flogging” <bibl><ref target="#SEN">Senate 596</ref></bibl>. This quote, coming

                     <p>In the mid-nineteenth century, Independence Day was a very important day to Americans.  In the United States, 
                        celebrations would last all day and include morning concerts, military reviews, children’s celebrations, 
                        processions, balloon ascensions, and firework displays.  Whole towns would be extravagantly decorated with flags, 
                        flowers, and banners.  But on a ship, those amenities would not be accessible.  Instead, crew members 
                        would honor the birth of their nation by reciting speeches and odes, giving prayer, singing songs, 
                        and reading the Declaration of Independence.  If food was available, lavish feasts would be prepared.  
                        In some cases, sickness at sea inhibited excessive celebration and the healthy settled for talking patriotically over dinner.</p>
                     <p>In regards to Fourth of July celebrations abroad, the extravagance and immensity of 
                        the celebrations varied depending on the time period and the country.  In a 
                        <title level="m">New York Times</title> news article published <date when="1872-06-06">July 6, 1872</date> displays many of the countries that had 
                        celebrations that year for the Fourth of July including, Switzerland, England, France, 
                        and Germany.  In each of these countries the holiday was celebrated in very similar ways
                        to how <persName ref="#LAD">Louisa Doane</persName> describes her celebration; there were banquets with a large array 
                        of food and drink and long lists of people who were in attendance and at the end of the
                        night in France, “The utmost cordiality prevailed… and, amid great good feeling, the 
                        company separated at midnight with cheers for the French and American Republics”<bibl><ref target="#NYT1">New York Times</ref></bibl> 
                        It seems that the American Independence Day throughout the world was celebrated in much
                        the same way as it was in the States.  In most cases it seems that when Fourth of July 
                        celebrations occurred over seas during the 19th century it was mostly celebrated by
                        Americans that happen to be away from home at the time.  But there are several instances
                        where the celebrations were hosted by foreigners for their American friends.  In 
                        another <title level="m">New York Times</title> article published on <date when="1858-06-26">July 26, 1858</date> there was a toast made by an Englishman, who was hosting the festivities for his American guests, 
                        to the health of the American President<bibl><ref target="#NYT2">New York Times</ref></bibl>.  So over all it is clear that Independence Day 
                        was commonly recognized abroad and that <persName ref="#LAD">Doane</persName>'s description of her personal Fourth of July
                        party was typical for Americans even though they were away from home. </p>

                     <p><hi rend="bold">Epidemics At Sea</hi></p>
                     <p>Sea travel mobilized many people from
                        various regions, allowing diseases and epidemics to spread very quickly. One
                        method of containing illnesses was to try to quarantine ships with sick
                        sailors and travelers once they moved into the harbor, because the harbor
                        was a primary place for epidemics to spread from person to person and from
                        ship to ship. In the article "The Panama Fever" published in <hi
                           rend="italics">Overland Monthly and Out West Magazine</hi>, a traveler
                        mentions taking the substance "Quinine" before leaving their ship and going
                        ashore to Panama in the hopes that the medication might prevent them from
                        getting Panama Fever <bibl><ref target="Overland">553</ref></bibl>. The
                        illness was a strain of influenza that caused fever, nausea, vomiting, and
                        dehydration. Some people were able to overcome the illness, and others did
                        not <bibl><ref target="Thor">Thorington 150</ref></bibl>.</p>

                           Doane</persName> mentions Panama Fever during the time <persName
                           ref="#LAD">her</persName> ship was stationed in a harbor in South
                        America. <persName ref="#LAD">She</persName> mentions on <persName
                           ref="#LAD">her</persName> entry for <date when="1853-11-02">February 11,
                           1853</date> that six people from a neighboring ship had already died from
                        the fever and that the ship was quarantined, not allowing any passengers
                        from it to go on shore, and potentially spread the disease.</p>
                     <p>In addition to Panama Fever, Cholera and
                        Scurvy were very common on sea-faring vessels. In today's age Scurvy is only
                        mentioned as an illness of the past. According to the <hi rend="italics"
                           >London Journal of Medicine</hi>, Vol. 1, No. 2 (Feb. 1849), the author
                        states, “It had become a matter of general belief, that Scurvy died with the
                        last century: for, excepting in badly equipped vessels, the disease did not
                        manifest itself” <bibl><ref target="Bird">181</ref></bibl>. Doctors have
                        concluded that the treatment for Scurvy is nitrate. Scurvy was common among
                        sailors because “holds, decks, and hatches, were so objectionable in a
                        sanitary point of view… yet all suffered alike from Scurvy, simply because
                        there was one peculiar condition common to all, namely, the want of
                        vegetables” <bibl><ref target="Bird">189</ref></bibl>. In the days before
                        refrigeration, only salted meats and grains could withstand perishing over
                        time, and vegetables unfortunatly had a short shelf life, which made it hard
                        to consume them over long sea voyages. If vessels ended up low on
                        provisions, the conquered threat of Scurvy could become fearfully resurgent.
                     </p>
                     <p>Cholera was also another disease that
                        infected many sailors and passengers. The <date when="1832-06">July
                           1832</date> issue of <hi rend="italics">The North American Review</hi>
                        speaks about Cholera and says, “it began in maritime towns, as it had been
                        said that Cholera does, and thence spread to the interior” <bibl><ref
                              target="NorthAmerRevi">98</ref></bibl>. Since Cholera got its
                        beginnings in maritime towns, it would be inevitable for a sailor to
                        contract the disease. Later in that article, an eyewitness to an outbreak
                        states, “the Cholera didn’t appear till seven days after she [the ship] had
                        had intercourse with the shore” <bibl><ref target="NorthAmerRevi"
                           >105</ref></bibl>. This proves that Cholera has a gestation period, and
                        the disease could easily overtake a vessel at sea in days. Cholera also
                        thrives in filth, as ship surgeon <persName>Thomas Graham</persName> said in
                        a journal, “There appears now to be no doubt but that a specific virus was
                        brought on board by one of the soldiers, which has been called into action
                        by the foul air from holds and crowded lower deck. The majority of the cases
                        occurred among the soldiers who lived in the filthiest, most unventilated
                        and overcrowded parts of the ship” <bibl><ref target="Graham"
                           >p12.v</ref></bibl>.</p>
                     <p>All three of these diseases spread quickly,
                        and espicially among many individuals living in the close, unsanitary
                        conditions on ships. Ship harbors were the perfect places for these
                        illnesses spread, and those infected on the ships carried the illness to the
                        next destination on their journey. The threat of an epidemic on board would
                        easily thwart <persName ref="#LAD">Lousia Doane's</persName> voyage.

                        completed their voyage without any major ilnesses, but <persName ref="#LAD"
                           >her</persName> journal's mention of such is a historically relevant
                        account of epidemics on sea voyages as a fairly common and often devistating
                        occurance.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="bold">19th Century Merchant Vessels</hi></p>
                     <p> Throughout her journal, <persName
                        ref="#LAD">Louisa Doane</persName> refers to a variety of sailing vessels
                        that she encounters during her voyages abroad. Her references are not
                        particularly informative - <persName ref="#LAD">Doane</persName> generally
                        only mentions the name and type of vessel, and even her most descriptive
                        references are little more than remarks on the appearance of certain ships.
                        This is perhaps understandable, as there seems to have been some debate as
                        to what exactly constituted a ship in the 19th century. Author <persName
                           ref="#AQC">Arthur Thomas Quiller-Couch</persName> puts it best in <title
                              level="m">The story of the sea, Volume 1</title>, saying that, "A ship,
                        according to Act of Parliament, is 'any fabric that is not propelled by
                        oars.' This is how the law defines it, but any sailor will tell you that in
                        this matter, as Mr. Bumble once remarked, 'the law is a hass'" <bibl><ref
                           target="#STS">20</ref></bibl>. However brief, <persName ref="#LAD"
                              >Doane's</persName> notations are nevertheless an indication of the
                        importance of ships and the solidarity between sailing vessels in
                        19th-century sea trade. The casual, cursory remarks made in the journal
                        suggest that <persName ref="#LAD">Doane</persName> was at least vaguely
                        familiar with the types of ships she mentions, and she indeed boarded many
                        of these vessels and visited with the captains and their
                        families.</p>
                     <p><hi rend="bold">Clipper Ships</hi>. The
                        term "clipper ship" was applied to a ship to indicate that it sailed very
                        fast. They often carried very valuable items. <bibl><ref target="Hittel">"A
                           history of the city of San Francisco</ref></bibl> Extreme clippers
                        sacrificed cargo capacity for speed. California clippers could transport
                        large quantities of goods quickly. The range of clipper ship models were so
                        diverse, that it is impossible to make generalizations about their
                        appearance. The American clipper ship era really only extended from 1845 to
                        1859.<bibl><ref target="Clipper">"Clipper

                     <p><hi rend="bold">Schooners</hi>. One very prevalent vessel during the 19th
                        century was the schooner. According to the Oxford English dictionary online,
                        a schooner is “A small sea-going fore-and-aft rigged vessel, originally with
                        only two masts, but now often with three or four masts and carrying one or
                        more topsails.” They were often used because they needed a comparatively
                        smaller crew than other similar sized ships. Schooners were used for many
                        things in the 19th century, but its original purpose was to transport cargo.
                        Often, however, it was used for more devious purposes. There are accounts of
                        Schooners being used to transport slaves<bibl><ref target="#DOS">"The Doom
                              of the Slaver"</ref></bibl> and also being used as pirate vessels(in
                        1822 the schooner <name ref="#Aspray">Aspray</name> was chased down by two
                        pirate vessels, both were schooners.)<bibl><ref target="#JOV">"Journal of
                              Voyages"</ref></bibl>. Also, the Schooner <name ref="#Dolphin"
                           >Dolphin</name> was used by the United States Navy in 1825 to track down
                        mutineers from the whale ship <name ref="#Globe">Globe</name>. The mutineers
                        had taken the whaling ship to the Mulgrave islands, but when they went on
                        shore loyal sailors took control of the ship and brought it back to the
                        United States. At that time the commodore of the naval squadron in the
                        Pacific was ordered to dispatch the schooner Dolphin to track down the
                        mutineers and capture them so an example could be made of them<bibl><ref
                              target="#JCD">"Journal of a Cruise of the United States Schooner
                              Dolphin"</ref></bibl>. Also, according to Hunt's Yachting Magazine, “A
                        large cutter of from 70 to 100 tons will be found a very far more expensive
                        vessel to handle than a schooner of equal tonnage”(ROY). It was cheeper to
                        use a schooner because, due to the way it was rigged, it took less people to
                        handle it. From these examples, you can see that schooners were used for a
                        variety of things in the 19th century, even though they were most commonly
                        used as merchant vessels. </p>
                     <p><hi rend="bold">Barque</hi>.  One type of ship mentioned specifically by
                           <persName ref="#LAD">Doane</persName> is the bark (alternatively spelled
                        barque). In Man on the Ocean, an account of numerous ocean-going vessels and
                        sailing history, Scottish author <persName ref="#RMB">R. M.
                           Ballantyne</persName> goes into great detail when describing the bark and
                        what differentiates it from other similar ships. He writes, "The vessel next
                        in size larger than the brig, is the barque. It does not follow, however,
                        that its being larger constitutes it a barque. Some brigs are larger than
                        barques, but generally the barque is the larger vessel. The difference
                        between a barque and a brig is that the former has three masts, the two
                        front ones being square-rigged, and the mizzen being fore-and-aft rigged"
                              <bibl><ref target="#MTO">214</ref></bibl>. Despite having very
                        distinct sail-plans and rigging, barques were annoyingly similar to brigs
                        and barquentines, and the varying appearance of the barque makes it even
                        more difficult to differentiate it from other ships. For instance, adding a
                        fore-and-aft-rigged mizzen-mast to the after part of a brig would convert it
                        into a barque, just as a sharply-built and trim-rigged clipper barque is
                        simply a fast-sailing barque <bibl><ref target="#MTO">214</ref></bibl>.
                        Although she never goes into such technical detail, <persName ref="#LAD"
                           >Doane's</persName> references to ships of various types suggests two
                        things - that she either had enough knowledge of seafaring ships to

                     <p><hi rend="bold">Honoring the Dead at Sea</hi></p>
                     
                     <p>Burial at sea was not the ideal way for someone to be buried in the 1800s, but a 
                        necessity when someone died while on a ship at sea.  When a person was buried at 
                        sea, there was no way to mark the spot where the body was buried, which meant 
                        family and friends could not visit in the future to mourn.  An editorial article in the 
                        <title level="m">Maryland Gazette</title> from 1829 describes how members of a ship’s crew wrapped the
                        dead body in a hammock and put the body in a coffin before tossing it overboard <bibl><ref target="#ABurial">A Burial at Sea</ref></bibl>.  The crew wanted to respect the life lost by covering the body, 
                        though the body would sink to the bottom of the sea once thrown overboard.  <persName ref="#LAD">Doane</persName> 
                        mentions in her journal that the bodies of the dead were also wrapped in cloth before
                        the burial, but since <persName ref="#LAD">Doane</persName> was in the harbor, the crew was able to bury the body.  
                        Even though the body was buried, the crew sent out a small boat to sea in memory of 
                        the life lost.  A crew would most likely not come prepared to handle a death while at 
                        sea, but both crews did their best to respect the body and keep it covered for burial.</p>
                     
                     <p>Beyond the practical reasons for burial at sea, there was often much superstition 
                        surrounding the ceremony. On land, many burial rituals developed around the fear that 
                        the dead would return to haunt the living. Sailors struggled with this same concern, and 
                        many of their burial practices parroted land practices. The corpse on land is removed 
                        from a house feet first, so that the spirit would be unable to find its way back to its former 
                        home. Sailors adapted this practice to the sea by placing weights at the feet of the 
                        hammock so the feet would sink first, and the front of the body was usually oriented 
                        away from the ship when it was dumped into the sea <bibl><ref target="#BurialatSea">Stewart 280</ref></bibl>. Many other 
                        superstitions surrounded the burial process and the separation of dead from the living at 
                        sea, but <persName ref="#LAD">Doane</persName> curiously does not seem to share these concerns. While she describes the
                        sewing up of the bodies and once mentions that the deceased’s friends went to see the 
                        burial, she never mentions any ceremony surrounding the disposal of the dead, and she 
                        does not seem to share the common sailor’s fear of the soul returning if it is not properly laid to rest.</p>
                     
                     <p>In her journal, <persName ref="#LAD">Doane</persName> writes of deaths and funerals aboard the ship in a very professional 
                        manner. Because she is in some ways an apprentice to her <rs ref="#END">father</rs>, <persName ref="#LAD">Doane’s</persName> journal is more a captain’s 
                        log than an emotional account of events that occurred on ship. While many travel accounts from the time
                        describe the feelings evoked by the ceremony use words like "solemn" and "impressive" to describe it, <persName ref="#LAD">Doane</persName> refrains from describing the emotional
                        aspects of the burial <bibl><ref target="#BurialLeaf">Irving 237 </ref></bibl><bibl><ref target="#Adventures">Coultor 223</ref></bibl>. Instead, she provides a factual description of the practices, such as wrapping the bodies in cloth 
                        and sending them out in a boat. Death and funerals are a difficult part of life for many people, but 
                        visiting a burial site often helps with the feeling of loss of a loved one. However, Doane shows 
                        others(burials throughout the journal took place on other ships) who lost loved ones at sea who did 
                        not have the luxury of visiting a burial site. But <persName ref="#LAD">Doane</persName> seems to handle her emotions very well, saying only 
                        that the sight of one dead man made her “feel sad” <bibl><ref>Doane 47b</ref></bibl>. By reading what <persName ref="#LAD">Doane</persName> says about 
                        death and burials at sea, we can see that she is a very strong girl who is much wiser than her young years.</p>

                     <p><hi rend="bold">Discipline and Prisoner Treatment Aboard Ship</hi></p>
                     <p>Discipline was an important part of life aboard ship. From the captain's stand point, it was needed for order and allowed jobs on ship
                        to be performed safely and effectively <bibl><ref target="#AWAP">Pollock 24</ref></bibl>. Discipline was seen as 
                        needed for the protection of the sailors. The captain of the ship was the enforcer of all punishment. Discipline on board ship was based on the captain <bibl><ref target="#TH">Hodgskin 35</ref></bibl>.
                        If the captain of the ship changed or if a crew member joined a new ship the rules and regulations changed. Discipline was considered a direct reflection on the captain
                        <bibl><ref target="#TH">Hodgskin 35</ref></bibl>. If a ship had a long list of crew members getting punished, it looked bad on the captain. <persName ref="#END">Captain Doane</persName> would have
                        continuingly been dealing with the discipline of his crew and prisoners. Some of the problems <rs ref="#END">he</rs> would have faced with <rs ref="#END">his</rs> crew and prisoners would have com from
                        problems like drunkness, rioting, theft, and unlawful violence <bibl><ref target="#AWAP">Pollock 24</ref></bibl>. According to several of <persName ref="#LAD">Lousia Doane's</persName>entries,
                        the crew and prisoners on <rs ref="#LAD">her</rs> <rs ref="#END">father's</rs> ship were constanttly trying to steal food. On <date when="1853-03-16">March 16, 1853</date>, the prisoners were caught stealing
                        bread. On <date when="1853-12-28">December 28,1853</date>, a <persName>sailor</persName> asked <persName ref="#END">Captain Doane</persName> for more molasses. <persName ref="#END">Captain Doane</persName>
                        says the <persName>sailor</persName> had already received his ration of molasses and will be given no more. The <persName>sailor</persName> threatens to steal the molasses. Poor conditions on many ships were 
                        thought to escalate problems on board. However, a good captain only used punishment if it was absolutely necessary.
                     </p>
                     <p>In the event that a sailor commited an offense that warranted imprisonment, it was again up to the captain to mete out punishment beyond that. For more serious crimes, they were sometimes removed from the
                        ship completely. In her entry from <date when="1852-04-19">Tuesday, April 19, 1852</date>, <persName ref="#LAD">Louisa Doane</persName> describes an incident in which the prisoners are freed after rats chew
                        through their iron shackles, and are roaming freely inside the ship. <rs ref="LAD">She</rs> writes that <rs ref="#LAD">her</rs> <rs ref="#END">father</rs> summoned an armed force to deal with the 
                        disobedience, and goes to shore to determine their ultimate fate. A few sentences later <rs ref="LAD">she</rs> says that "at noon a Policeman came off and took them all on Shore and [put] them in Prison".
                        For lesser offenses, the punishments were more mundane on the <name type="ship">Commonwealth</name>. In an entry on <date when="1853-03-07">Monday, March 7</date>, the prisoners are singing and being "saucy",
                        and are rebuked by having their suppers cut down to half a piece of bread. On <date when="1853-01-03">January 3</date>, <rs ref="#LAD">she</rs> recalls an occurrence when a fighting <persName>sailor</persName>
                        is whipped and put in irons. In the first half of the 19th century, there was a call to replace the more severe forms of corporal punishment with more humane treatment, as described by
                        <persName ref="#MCG">Myra C. Glenn</persName> in the article <title level="a">The Naval Reform Campaign Against Flogging: A Case Study in Changing Attitudes Toward Corporal Punishment, 1830-1850</title>.
                        <persName ref="#MCG">Glenn</persName> writes that the reformers "sought to discipline the mind, not to punish the body", and in <date when="1850">1850</date> naval flogging was outlawed
                        <bibl><ref target="#MCG">409</ref></bibl>. However, on a merchant ship such as the <name type="ship">Commonwealth</name>, not bound by the laws of the military, the ship's captain was essentially free to do
                        as he wished to the sailors, including flogging, which at times <persName ref="#MCG">Glenn</persName> says had the unintended effect of promoting "disorder and insubordination...[and that]repeated floggings
                        "hardened" sailors against officers and engendered "baneful feelings of insubordination" <bibl><ref target="#MCG">414</ref></bibl>. In some ways this harsh treatment of prisoners explains the continuous
                        disciplinary problems that <persName ref="#END">Captain Doane</persName> has with <rs ref="#END">his</rs> sailors, as <rs ref="#END">he</rs> is quite a harsh leader and disciplinarian.

                        Guano was of surplus in Peru for a very long time, mostly because of their fish market.  
                        Certain fish like anchovies and others were attracted to the 
                        <bibl><ref target="#Panda">Humboldt Current in the Eastern Pacific ocean</ref></bibl> which in turn attracted birds 
                        like white-breast cormorants, gray pelicans, and piqueros to the area for the fish.  
                        The Humboldt Current brings in nutrient filled water to the shores vital for the guano and sustains 
                        the <bibl><ref target="#Panda">marine ecosystem for marine life and birds.</ref></bibl> 
                        The bird droppings then would retain the nitrate in it and then producing Guano.  
                        The industry was at its peak from around 1840-1880, when they sold upwards of 
                        20 million tons mostly to Great Britain, 
                        <bibl><ref target="#IncaPeru">earning the country of Peru around 2 billion dollars in profits.</ref></bibl>

                        Guano was used for fertilizer and fire powder during this time and was in great demand.  
                        <placeName ref="#Peru">Peru</placeName> then lost the rights of 
                        the guano to Chile and then the rest to France 
                        when the countries were preparing for war. 
                        The situation of the industry turned sour after World War I when the 
                        Germans invented something in place of guano which was 
                        the Haber process, making guano have no value.  
                        The fish population declined which in turn meant less and less birds 
                        that would come there, which meant less bird droppings for the guano to produce.  
                        <bibl><ref target="#Acquisition">There is also the Guano Islands Act of 1856 where the islands that produce

                     <p>One of the topics <persName ref="#LAD">Louisa Doane</persName> discusses in detail in <rs ref="#LAD">her</rs> journal is that of health.  
                        <rs ref="#LAD">Her</rs> concern in reporting on this topic reflects a broader interest in the health and 
                        medical treatment of sailors and sea-travelers evidenced in publications of the time. 
                        The <date when="1842-12-31">December 31, 1842</date> issue of <title level="m">The Friend: A Religious and Literary Journal</title> reprints 
                        a review of the new edition of <title level="m">Physician for Ships</title> which originally appeared in the 
                        <title level="m">Boston Medical and Surgical Review</title>.  The reviewer remarks favorably on the volume, 
                        saying, "Sailors suffer exceedingly for the want of medical advice.  All vessels, 
                        or nearly all, have a medicine chest, but no medical directions worthy of credence...Our 
                        merchants ought to put a copy on board of every vessel leaving port" <bibl><ref target="#BMSS">107</ref></bibl>.  
                        <persName ref="#LAD">Doane</persName> makes no mention of such a book on board the ships <rs ref="#LAD">she</rs> sails on, but <persName ref="#LAD">Doane</persName> does 
                        mention <rs ref="#LAD">her</rs> <rs ref="#END">father</rs> administering medicine on several occasions.  The picture <persName ref="#LAD">Louisa 
                           Doane</persName> draws of seafaring medicine, therefore, shows <rs ref="#LAD">her</rs> <rs ref="#END">father</rs> as the chief medical 
                        man on board, diagnosing and dispensing according to <rs ref="#END">his</rs> judgment, and often with the 
                        help of <persName ref="#LAD">Doane</persName> and <rs ref="#LAD">her</rs> <rs ref="#ATD">mother</rs>.  Significantly, the quality of care that the men receive 
                        under <persName ref="#END">Captain Doane’s</persName> command stands in contrast to that received by <persName ref="#LAD">Doane</persName> and <rs ref="#LAD">her</rs> <rs ref="#END">father</rs> 
                        on shore from a licensed physician.  With some historical context, one may read <persName ref="#LAD">Doane’s</persName> 
                        journal as evidence of how the differential care of sailors and individuals at sea versus 
                        on land highlighted class differences, and particularly demonstrates the common disregard 
                        for the health of merchant mariners in the 19th century.</p>
                     
                     <p><hi rend="bold">Disparate Care: The Navy and the Merchant Marine</hi> <persName ref="#END">Captain Doane's </persName>service 
                        as primary medical practitioner aboard 
                        the <name type="ship">Commonwealth</name> points to the varied accessibility to and quality 
                        of medical care available to sailors in the 19th century.  Nineteenth 
                        century medical treatment and practice for sailors was differentiated 
                        by employer affiliation: naval sailors received higher quality and more 
                        consistent health care than merchant marine sailors.  This was due in 
                        large part to the fact that naval sailors were responsible for protecting 
                        the nation, whereas merchant mariners were often employed on a case-by-case 
                        basis, one voyage at a time.  Contemporary physician <persName ref="#GB">Gilbert Blane</persName> explains: 
                        "Money would avail nothing to the public defence without a sufficient number 
                        of able and healthy men, which are the real resources of a state, and the true 
                        sinews of war" <bibl><ref target="#Observations"><persName ref="#CL">Lloyd</persName> 151</ref></bibl>.  In contrast to views of naval sailors as the 
                        "true sinews of war," mercantile mariners were seen as replaceable and therefore 
                        commercial ship owners experienced less economic and moral pressure to maintain 
                        quality healthcare on board their ships.  In his examination of 19th century 
                        British merchant ships, <persName ref="#GCC">G.C. Cook</persName> highlights the perceived expendability of 
                        these sailors: "merchant seamen…lived a most erratic existence—often being 
                        employed (frequently by ship owners who were often unscrupulous) for a 
                        single voyage only" <bibl><ref target="#ScurvyBrit">225</ref></bibl>.</p>
                     
                     <p><hi rend="bold">Medical Care on the <name type="ship">Commonwealth</name></hi>
                        This attitude of expendability that informed the treatment of mercantile sailors’ health is
                        documented in <persName ref="#LAD">Doane’s</persName> journal as well and represents a significant 
                        characterization of the relationship between <persName ref="#END">Captain Doane</persName> and the sailors 
                        in his charge.  The importance of their health and the seriousness of their 
                        illness is downplayed significantly in two instances, on <date when="1852-10-14">October 14</date> and <date when="1852-08-24">August 24</date>, 
                        1852, respectively, wherein <persName ref="#LAD">Doane</persName> reports 
                        that <persName ref="#END">Captain Doane</persName> believes sailors are "making believe" that they are ill 
                        or "fained [sic] sick."  However, even when actual illness is acknowledged 
                        and treated by <persName ref="#END">Captain Doane</persName>, concern for the sailor’s wellbeing is seen 
                        second to his ability to perform the duties for which he has been hired.</p>

                        during this voyage might help explain <rs ref="#LAD">her</rs> more vague 
                        references to the treatment of the sailor, it could 
                        also be seen as reflecting the ways in which merchant 
                        sailors were not shown much concern, especially since 
                        fits were considered very serious in the 19th century.

                        apoplectic, epileptic, fainting, and hysteric.  
                        Fainting and hysteric fits were largely the province 
                        of women, and <persName ref="#JE">Ewell</persName> discusses apoplectic and epileptic 
                        fits as being very dangerous, saying of apoplectic fits, 
                        "In the cure of a disease, threatening such sudden fatality, 
                        remedies must be speedily employed" <bibl><ref target="#PlantersMariners">114</ref></bibl>.

                        the sailor's health as in grave danger at the 
                        time of his fit, <rs ref="#LAD">she</rs> does note in <rs ref="#LAD">her</rs> <date when="1853-01-01">January 1, 1853</date> 
                        entry that he still seems very sick and has

                        he is convinced that he "was going to Die as he 
                        had the chills upon him."  The <persName ref="#END #ATD">Doanes'</persName> response 
                        is to take the sailor's pulse and then reassure 
                        him that it is strong and he has little to worry 
                        about.  <persName ref="#HL">Harold Langley</persName>, in a study of the early 
                        U.S. Navy, notes that the pulse was considered 
                        an indicator of health and that "If the pulse 
                        was slow or weak, the doctor concluded that 
                        the vascular fibers were weak or lax.  If the 
                        pulse was fast, the physician deduced that the 
                        vascular fibers were hyperactive and that fever 
                        was present, for hyperactivity produced heat" <bibl><ref target="#HistoryMed">31</ref></bibl>.  
                        A strong pulse, therefore, would be indicative of
                        health.  The medicine which <persName ref="#LAD">Doane</persName> says <rs ref="#LAD">her</rs> <rs ref="#ATD #END">parents</rs> 
                        dispense to the sailor is not named, but it is likely 
                        that it was a purgative&#x2014;either a laxative or an emetic&#x2014;since 
                        purging was considered to be the first course of 
                        treatment when fevers were feared <bibl><ref target="#PlantersMariners"><persName ref="#JE">Ewell</persName> 25</ref></bibl>, and, as 
                        <persName ref="#HL">Langley</persName> notes, cathartics (laxatives) and emetics were 
                        among three of the most commonly-prescribed treatments 
                        for ailments in the 19th century <bibl><ref target="#HistoryMed">31</ref></bibl>.</p>

                        Following the documentation of the sailor’s fear of 
                        Panama Fever and the administration of the medicine, 
                        <persName ref="#LAD">Doane</persName> notes in the next day's entry that the sailor's 
                        health is greatly improved and that he has returned to 
                        his work, which illustrates that the main purpose of 
                        administering medical care to any sailor on board would 
                        be to make him fit for duty as quickly as possible.  
                        Providing medicine to sailors on board merchant vessels, as we can 
                        see from this episode, depends largely on the needs 
                        and judgment of the captain of the ship, who is invested 
                        more in maintaining their required work regimen by dosing 
                        sick sailors with medicines perceived to be generally effective 
                        than in diagnosing and treating them with care and precision.

                        ship, "at home...there was considerable feeling that the federal 
                        government had a responsibility to provide for seamen who were 
                        permanently disabled by shipboard accidents or who returned to

                        medical attention abroad <bibl><ref target="#HistoryMed"><persName ref="#HL">Langley</persName> 3</ref></bibl>.  As a result, the care 
                        that individuals received on land was significantly superior 
                        in quality to that which they received at sea.

                     <p>
                        <persName ref="#LAD">Doane</persName> frequently records what she eats and
                        cooks at sea, and she includes stories about various livestock kept on
                        board. These notations in her journal signal to us as contemporary readers
                        that food and diet are central concerns for crew and passengers. In fact,
                        <persName ref="#LAD">Doane's</persName> account suggests that food and
                        diet are connected to all kinds of other social interactions on board,
                        including social hierarchies, ship discipline, hospitality between ships, and
                        general health concerns. This preoccupation with food makes sense given that
                        while out to sea those on board only had access to food stocked on
                        the ship or food given to them by other ships they met at sea.  With limited
                        resources, the risk of spoiling or damage to food, and both sailors and
                        passengers to feed, food becomes bound up with the social lives of those on
                        board in several interesting ways. </p>
                     <p> The kinds of foods <persName ref="#LAD"
                        >Doane</persName> eats on board seem consistent with other accounts of
                        the foods ships generally took with them to sea. In his account of life on
                        merchant ships, <persName ref="#FTB">Frank Thomas Bullen</persName> writes
                        that American ships often had the best food stocks compared to other
                        countries <bibl><ref target="#MMS">214</ref></bibl>. According to his
                        experiences sailing in the mid to late 1800s, American ships generally kept
                        potatoes, onions, flour, dried apples, and cranberries in addition to the
                        usual staples of salt beef and pork, bread, rice, and pea soup <bibl><ref
                           target="#MMS">214</ref></bibl>. This variety is important because
                        ships that carried fewer vegetables often struggled with bouts of illness,
                        particularly scurvy. <persName ref="#LAD">Doane</persName> mentions eating
                        plenty of salted meats, but she also records eating pancakes and potatoes,
                        making fruit jelly, trading fruit cake with one ship, and receiving oranges,
                        onions, and pumpkins from another ship. She notes that they carry pigs and
                        chickens on board to kill and eat in addition to the stocked cured meat.
                        This variety of food is probably related to her social position on board,
                        but it demonstrates the kinds of foods ships comfortably could sail with.
                        Her <persName ref="#ATD">mother's</persName> birthday celebration provides a
                        case in point: for the dinner they feast on boiled beef, pork, potatoes,
                        prunes, wine, lemonade, plum pudding, and pumpkin pie. Even the sailors
                        receive wine and cake for this special celebration. </p>
                     <p>
                        <persName ref="#LAD">Doane's</persName> journal also shows the ways in which
                        food could function as both a privilege or a means of disciplining the
                        sailors. In her book <title level="m">Food in the United States</title>,
                        historian <persName ref="#SW">Susan Williams</persName> has chronicled the
                        ways in which food increasingly became associated with social status during
                        the 19th century. She writes, "For a rapidly growing American middle class,
                        the meal structure, food served, presentation, and dining rituals all
                        reinforced new standards of gentility" <bibl><ref target="#FUS"
                           >153</ref></bibl>. On board, we can see this relationship between social
                        status and dining in several ways. At one point, the Doane family allows the
                        carpenter, who is not usually invited to eat with them because he is a
                        "foreigner" of unknown origins, to eat with them in the cabin. <persName
                           ref="#LAD">Doane</persName> later finds out that the carpenter felt
                        embarrassed not only to be eating with them, but also to be eating while her
                        <persName ref="#ATD">mother</persName> sat at the table.</p> 
                     <p> On other occassions, <persName ref="#LAD"
                        >Doane</persName> witnesses sailors being denied food for 'misbehaving'.
                        For example, on March 3rd, one sailor asks the captain if he thinks that the
                        ration of potatoes given to the crew is enough for six men. The captain
                        responds by taking away all their potatoes as punishment for complaining
                        about their fare. Sources from around the time period suggest that depriving
                        sailors of food was not necessarily considered an appropriate means of
                        punishing them. In his 1879 edition of <title level="m">The seaman's
                           friend</title>, <persName ref="#RHDJ">R. H. Dana Jr.</persName> asserts
                        that all crew members have a right to food, and under no occassion should
                        the ship's master deny sailors this right <bibl><ref target="#SF"
                           >209</ref></bibl>. In fact, <persName ref="#RHDJ">Dana</persName>
                        suggests that sailors could technically win money in court if they proved
                        they had been denied food. That we see sailors denied basic food like
                        potatoes suggests that while at sea such rules were not always followed. But

                        are the writings of captain's wives, not captain's daughters, though it has

                        woman's life at sea. Personal diaries are often gendered as female, and in
                        the Victorian period, the diary genre enjoyed the distinction of being the
                        "preeminent form of written expression among women" <bibl><ref

                        sea journal is also somewhat of a hybrid form, as these diarists would often
                        include elements specific to a ship's log, a type of writing "normally the
                        province of men," specifically male sea captains <bibl><ref

                        lowering of sails, and carefully noted wind and weather conditions in her
                        entries, we are able to conjecture that she was simultaneously in the

                        their grand European tours (see, for example, <figure rend="link"><head> Samuel 
                           Sullivan Cox's "Journal of a Tour to Europe"</head><graphic 
                              url="http://people.cohums.ohio-state.edu/ulman1/SSCoxJournal/"/></figure>). 
                        Her desire to reach Marseille, exhibited in her entry dated 
                        29th March, seems not to stem from the excitement of seeing new places, but 
                        rather from an understandable longing to finally get off the ship: <q>"if this wind 
                           continues we shall get there tomorrow morning [. . .] Oh dear I hope we shall, 
                           for this is fifty two days at sea which is a long passage, and I am quite tired."
                        </q></p>
                     <p>Not surprisingly then, <persName ref="#LAD">Doane</persName>'s 
                        first entries upon arriving in <placeName ref=

                        their boarding house, and provides long lists of what was served to them at mealtimes:

                        The extent to which she documents these details suggest the sense of 
                        joy that must have accompanied her arrival on dry land, where food was varied and 
                        plentiful, and her accomodation was, as she notes, made of <q>"stone" (1 April 1852)</q>!</p>
                     <p>During their time in <placeName ref="#Marseille">Marseille</placeName>, 
                        <persName ref="#LAD">Doane</persName>
                        and her parents chose to stay at an American hotel. Writing for the <title level="m">
                           The Western Monthly </title>in 1869, Joseph Kirkland was quick to criticize such
                        institutions, arguing that, <q>"to go to an American hotel abroad, and otherwise
                           to herd with one's own fellow countrymen, is a confession of homesickness and of
                           regret for having left home at all. The place to see Americans is America. In
                           foreign lands the true sight to be seen is <q>'These Foreigners'</q>" </q>(248).
                        <persName ref="#LAD">Doane</persName>, however, did not share his 
                        contempt. She notes that the landlady, though
                        French, had happily, <q>"been in New York a number of years and could speak very 
                           good <sic>english</sic>" </q>and is delighted
                        to find that friends of their's, a <persName ref="#Eliott">Captain Eliott </persName>
                        and his family, are also staying at the hotel (1 April
                        1852). Again, <persName ref="#LAD">Doane</persName>'s 
                        warm enthusiasm seems to suggest some relief at once 
                        more finding herself amongst familiar company, and perhaps recalls an earlier occasion
                        at sea when she wistfully observes women on-board a passing ship: <q>"we saw there
                           were two ladies on board, which was quite a party <sic>to to </sic>us, 
                           as we have been out forty three days, and have seen nothing but

                     <p>Whether or not <persName ref="#LAD">Doane</persName> 
                        did think of herself as a young holiday-maker in France,
                        her time in <placeName ref="#Marseille">Marseille </placeName>seems to be have been
                        as much practically spent as it was leisurely. She records details of a number of
                        visits to the dentist, and refers to a shopping trip, both of which, after so long at sea,
                        must have been all too necessary. The imminence of their departure must surely have 
                        been ever-present in <persName ref="#LAD">Doane</persName>'s 
                        mind, and might be imagined to have had some influence
                        over the way in which she spent her days in <placeName ref="#Marseille">Marseille
                        </placeName>. Certainly, in addition to her more practical excursions, 
                        <persName ref="#LAD">Doane</persName> seems 
                        to have been keen to make the most of her time abroad, and her journal entries 
                        describe trips around <placeName ref="#Marseille">Marseille </placeName>and the 
                        local culture. Although she rarely refers to sites that she visited by name, the 
                        details she gives suggest that she visited both the Abbaye Saint-Victor and the
                        Porte D'Aix, in addition to making frequent trips around the city on foot and 
                        horseback.</p>
                     <p>Had she consulted the various contemporary guidebooks available to American 
                        tourists however, and whether or not she did is, of course, difficult to know, 
                        she may have been disappointed. <title level="m">A Satchel Guide for the Vacation
                           Tourist</title>, published in 1924, dedicates barely more than half a page to 
                        <placeName ref="#Marseille">Marseille</placeName>, while John Murray's 
                        <title level="m">A Handbook for Travellers in France </title>(1867) and 
                        <title level="m">Norton's Hand-Book to Europe; or, How to Travel in the Old World 
                        </title>(1860) have little in the way of praise to offer France's biggest sea-port.
                        Indeed, writing in the <title level="m">Norton's Hand-Book</title>, J. H. Siddons
                        warns his readers that <placeName ref="#Marseille">Marseille </placeName><q>"has
                           all the disagreeable features of an ordinary sea-port town, and some very offensive
                           ones which are peculiarly its own," </q>and advises that they <q>"regulate [their]
                              arrival at <placeName ref="#Marseille">Marseille </placeName>that the place may
                              be immediately quitted for Malta and Alexandria" <bibl><ref target="#Siddons">
                                 (167)</ref></bibl>. </q>That is about the full extent of his observations about
                        <persName ref="#LAD">Doane</persName>'s destination. Murray goes into more 
                        detail, but is hardly any more positive.
                        The port he describes as the <q>"sewer of the city"</q>, the old town as <q>
                           "scarcely worth entering" <bibl><ref target="#Murray">(476)</ref></bibl></q>, 
                        and his account of the artwork displayed in various council buildings is no less
                        scathing: <q>"The subjects are all horrible"</q>, he notes, <q>"and the execution 
                           not good enough to compensate" <bibl><ref target="#Murray">(467)</ref></bibl></q>.
                     </p>
                     <p>If <persName ref="#LAD">Doane</persName> found any of this to be true, she 
                        gives no indication of it in her
                        journal, and the delight with which she records the details of her dinners and 
                        suppers, her various expeditions and walks through the city, and the warmth with 
                        which she describes the friends that she met there, suggest that her stay in 
                        <placeName ref="#Marseille">Marseille </placeName>was, in spite of the guidebooks,
                        quite pleasant. Perhaps
                        she, unlike Murray, Siddons, and Rolfe, had an appreciation for the sea-port town
                        that came with her maritime experience, or perhaps simply from having arrived after 
                        a very long 54 days at sea.</p>

                           Vessel</emph></p>  
                     <p>The voyages Louisa Doane's father,
                           <persName ref="END">Captain Edmund Doane</persName>, undertook were
                        primarily in the service of larger merchants and other industries. As
                        captain of a merchant vessel, <rs type="person" ref="END">Captain
                           Doane's</rs> daily routine involved an absolute awareness and intricate
                        negotiation of responsibility for the temporary ownership of the ship's
                        cargo. <title level="m">The American Ship-Master's Daily Assistant</title>,
                        an 1807 guide to maritime law, clearly suggests that the primary concern for
                        the master of any vessel was his responsibility for the ship's cargo
                              <bibl><ref target="ASMDA"><title level="m">The American Ship-Master's
                                 Daily Assistant</title> 1</ref></bibl>. According to maritime laws,
                        the master of the vessel remained responsible for all damages occurring to
                        cargo once aboard. The only exceptions to these laws were any damages
                        attributed to "an act of God" and theft by piracy at sea. Any damage
                        occurring due to poor ship maintenance (water damage for example), theft
                        occurring while at port, damage by the crew or sailors, and even damage by
                        rats was deemed the legal responsibility of the captain. This principle of
                        responsibility significantly shapes life onboard including issues of
                        discipline and the emphasis <persName ref="LAD">Louisa Doane</persName>
                        gives to the animal life onboard.</p>
                     <p>Although the owners of the ship were
                        responsible for the cost of any damages needing attention that were not the
                        fault of the captain or crew, the captain was required to pull into a port
                        as soon as possible once damage detrimental to the ship and ship's cargo
                        occurred. When questioned, the master of the vessel had to be able immediate
                        response to be the case, making ship's logs extremely important. Any damage
                        occurring while at sea was to be declared immediately upon the arrival of
                        the vessel into port. Often, damage attributed to "acts of God" would
                        require confirmation by multiple sources. These sources included not only
                        official documents like the captain's log and ship manifests, but also
                        testimonies by crew members or passengers. Not only does the captain's
                        responsibility for the cargo explain <persName ref="LAD">Louisa
                           Doane</persName>'s repeated remarks about her <rs type="person" ref="END"
                           >father</rs>'s concern for the ship's official documents (logs and

                        conditions at sea throughout the journal as well as her meticulous
                        documentation of agents embarkation and debarkation while at port in

                     <p>The decade of the clipper ship domination
                        saw an expansion of commercial interests that <persName ref="LAD">Louisa
                           Doane</persName>'s journal was clearly a part of. Although readers see
                           <rs type="person" ref="END">Doane</rs>'s ship stopping at various ports
                        for different exchanges, one of the most fascinating episodes includes their
                        trip to obtain guano from <rs type="place" ref="LobosIslands">islands of the
                           coast of Peru </rs>. The guano industry in the mid-nineteenth century
                        marks a unique period in the development of international commercial
                        interests, with some scholars declaring the guano industry and the 1856
                           <title level="a">Guano Act</title> to be the first clear attempt by the
                        United States to secure international commercial resources through

                        suggests that early in the 1850's, the market developed so quickly that a
                        clear public knowledge of what the product was or what it was to be used for
                        was not entirely clear.</p>
                     <p>Despite the impetus to proceed with caution
                        to preserve precious cargo like the guano obtained from the <placeName

                           Edmund Doane</persName>'s journeys were chartered by pioneers of the
                        transportaion industry, each with particular attachments to developments in
                        merchant vessels. The specific companies operating in the background of
                        Doane's journeys include the merchant company <orgName ref="HowAsp">Howland
                           and Aspinwall</orgName> who chartered part of their voyage, and the
                        paternrship of <orgName ref="FN">Foster's and Nickerson</orgName> who were
                        partial owners of the <name type="ship">Commonwealth</name>. <orgName
                           ref="HowAsp">Howland and Aspinwall</orgName> was a prestigious firm at
                        the forefront of transportation developments in the mid-nineteenth century.
                        The firm is credited with funding the construction of innovative streamlined
                        ship designs like the <name type="ship">Sea Witch</name> that travelled
                        from <placeName ref="NYC">New York</placeName> to China in a record
                        seventy-nine days in 1849. Shipbuilding and merchant companies like the
                        parternship created by <orgName ref="FN">Foster and Nickerson</orgName> were
                        not only deeply involved in this boom of shipbuilding, but were also
                        particularly invested in the speed of ships rounding <placeName ref="CHorn"
                           >Cape Horn</placeName>. Records set by ships such as the <name

                        commercial interests, but created a shipbuilding market driven by a desire
                        for faster transportation. The partnership between <orgName ref="FN">Foster
                           and Nickerson</orgName> began, and continued with the desrire to charter
                        faster ships around <placeName ref="CHorn">Cape Horn</placeName>. This
                        shared desire for faster transportation not only paved the way for what the

                        1852. Although the Doanes' journey around the <rs type="place" ref="CHorn"
                           >Cape</rs> was not solely to transport goods from <placeName ref="NYC"
                           >New York</placeName> to <placeName ref="SF">San Francisco</placeName>
                        like most ships involved in the race, this competitive drive can be felt in
                           <rs type="person" ref="LAD">Doane's</rs> comparison of the speed and

                     </p>
                     <p>The epoch of sailing around the Horn in search of guano was incredibly brief. The Peruvian
                        guano trade was profitable, but short lived. At the time of <persName ref="#LAD">Doane</persName>’s journey in 1852, sailing
                        around <placeName ref="#CHorn">Cape Horn</placeName> was the only way to “efficiently” move goods and people from Atlantic to
                        Pacific. There was no naturally occurring break between North and South America, from the
                        Arctic Circle all the way to <placeName ref="#CHorn">Cape Horn</placeName>. The transcontinental railroad would not be completed
                        until 1869, and the Panama Canal was not finished until 1914. Before the completion of the
                        Canal and the availability of overland shipping, barks, windjammers, and other vessels
                        sailed all the way around the tip of South America to reach the other side of North America.
                     </p>
                     <p>Particularly in the immediate aftermath of the gold rush, the Drake Passage became a
                        busy shipping lane. Gathering guano from the <placeName ref="#ChinchaI">Chincha Islands</placeName>, the purpose of <persName ref="#LAD">Doane</persName>’s
                        journey, added more traffic to the sea. Dangerous and uncomfortable as it was, merchant
                        marines, passenger ships, and those who longed to move to California, during and after the
                        gold rush, made the journey round the <placeName ref="CHorn">Horn</placeName>. </p>

                        South America. It marks the northern boundary of the Drake Passage, the 600 mile stretch of ocean
                        between the rocky island and Antarctica, which is commonly considered the stormiest portion
                        of ocean in the world.</p>

                     <p>The dangers and discomfort of the journey have been thoroughly documented. Two other journals
                        from 1852, one by <bibl><ref target="#RoundHorn">Joseph Samson</ref></bibl> and the other by <bibl><ref target="#VoyageCalifornia">Lucy Kendall Herrick</ref></bibl>, also recount journeys around
                        <placeName ref="#CHorn">Cape Horn</placeName>. Rounding the <placeName ref="#CHorn">Horn</placeName>, the vagaries of wind and weather and the amount of human
                        misery caused by both, figures prominently in both. <persName ref="#LAD">Doane</persName>, who made her journey in the same
                        year, certainly acknowledges some of the hardships. </p>
                     
                     <p>But while <bibl><ref target="#VoyageCalifornia">Kendall</ref></bibl> uses hyperbolic terms to describe her experience and <bibl><ref target="RoundHorn">Samson</ref></bibl> titled his book
                        after that particular landmark, <persName ref="#LAD">Doane</persName> acknowledges it with
                        a simple, evocative phrase in her November 1 entry: “the long dreaded Place.” Her
                        descriptions of the sailors’ efforts to keep the ship safe are matter of fact about wild
                        water and wind. They adjust their sails before the wind, and try to cope with rolling seas.
                        For example on Nov 8, she describes the night: “a heavy Squall came and the
                        wind blowing a Huricane […] The wind howling through the rigging and the waves running high
                        and washing over us continually the vessel diving into the sea very deep.”</p>
                     
                     <p>Her even-handed account of a place that had (by then) acquired a reputation for savagery is
                        a valuable addition to the resource of familiar papers. <placeName ref="#CHorn">Cape Horn</placeName>
                        occupied a romantic place in the popular imagination of
                        mid-nineteenth-century Americans—it was viewed as the end of the Earth. Other discourses are
                        dominated by the discovery of “naked natives” and the deaths of missionaries who came to
                        convert the Yahgon. <persName ref="#LAD">Doane</persName> does not dwell on these discourses; her writing focuses on the
                        height of the waves and the situation it creates for sailors without mittens. </p>

            <p> This edition is the latest in a series of collaboratively produced electronic
               editions of previously unpublished nineteenth-century American manuscripts held in
               the Rare Books and Manuscripts Library at The Ohio State University. Previous
               editions include "My Dear Elizabeth," five letters written by Sophia Peabody
               Hawthorne to her sister Elizabeth Palmer Peabody between ca. 1837 and 1868 (currently
               being revised), "Dear Wife," twenty-one letters written by riverboat captain
               William B. Anderson to his wife Louisa while he plied the Ohio river during the
               height of the American Civil War, 1862–1864, and "Journal of a Tour to Europe," by
               Samuel Sullivan Cox. These documentary editions are intended
               to provide wide exposure and access to manuscripts that might otherwise be difficult
               for scholars to discover and consult, and to provide users with a variety of tools
               for studying those texts. </p>
            <p> Each text was edited in connection with an undergraduate or graduate course offered
               by H. Lewis Ulman, Associate Professor of English at The Ohio State University. The
               courses aim to provide students with an opportunity to explore issues of textuality
               and mediation that arise when our cultural archives spread from page to screen and
               from library shelves to networked databases. Electronic textual editing is our
               vehicle for examining what happens—and envisioning what might happen—when artifacts
               in one medium are represented in another medium, especially with regard to the
               interpretive work of reading. Electronic textual editions also provide a contact zone
               that can help us reflect on what manuscript, print, and "born digital" artifacts can
               tell us about their unique properties and their relationships to one another.</p>
            <p> While providing a reliable textual edition is a <foreign xml:lang="lat">sine qua
                  non</foreign>, the Doane edition also explores ways of telling four stories
               inextricably woven into our work: the lives and historical milieu evoked by the
               texts, the history of the physical journal (including its recent restoration), the
               editorial process that gave rise to this particular interpretation of the text, and
               the mediation of our electronic delivery system. </p>

               images at 400 dots per inch (dpi), then coverted to 8-bit JPEG images at 400 dpi and

               preparation, but a scan of a photographer's 18% grey card on the same scanner
               produced RGB values at the center of 91/95/107 after applying a 150% Gaussian Blur in
               Adobe Photoshop to average color values. Thus, a properly configured monitor should

                     A series of letters to the editor in an 1866 publication of the London Times reveals the alternative preventives proposed by many doctors; significantly,
                     "fresh succulent vegetables" as well as potatoes and "preserved potatoes" were thought to be a successful alternative 
                     that presented an easier pill for sailors to swallow. (<bibl><ref target="#Scurvy">"Scurvy"</ref></bibl>)

                                     Louisa Doane's time. Melville writes: "The Marquesas! What strange visions of outlandish things does the very name spirit up! Lovely [women]--cannibal banquets--groves of cocoa-nuts--coral reefs--tatooed chiefs..."<bibl><ref target="#Melville">3</ref></bibl>
                                     Though the islands were beautiful and exotic, people of the 19th century feared them. "Within the last few years American and English vessels engaged in the extensive whale fisheries of the Pacific
                                     have...put into the commodious harbor which there is in one of the islands; but a fear of the natives, founded on the recollection of the dreadful fate which many white men have received at their hands,
                                     has deterred their crews from intermixing with the population sufficiently to gain any insight in their peculiar customs and manners"<bibl><ref target="#Melville">4</ref></bibl>.
                                     In his narrative, Melville hoped to discover more about the Marquesas in order to "withdraw the veil from regions so romantic and beautiful"<bibl><ref target="#Melville">4</ref></bibl><figure rend="link">

                In the 19th century, Quinine was known to not only dispel fever, but it also cured pain and swelling caused from malarial infections. Manson describes in detail the effects of quinine on a patient:
                "I gave him twenty grains of quinine...and next morning, on awaking, the pain had vanished, and the inflammation of the muscles of the jaw 
                and general swelling of the face had diminished to such a degree that he could eat his breakfast"

                   intends you to be sea-sick. Now, if you will just nibble pilot's-bread for a day, and sip champagne--a table-spoonful at a dose--you will probably escape. Seasickness is all a notion anyhow" <bibl><ref target="#Appletons">44</ref></bibl>.
