                  <note type="introductory" resp="ed">
                     <p>On Friday, February 6, 1852, sixteen-year-old Louisa Doane and her mother,
                        Almira, set sail from New York in a merchant ship bound for Marseille,
                        France and commanded by her father, Edmund N. Doane. It was not unusual for
                        captains’ wives and children to accompany them on long voyages (“Families at
                        Sea: the Captain’s Wife”; Druett 90), and judging from Louisa Doane’s familiarity with
                        ships’ rigging, winds at sea, measurements of latitude and longitude, ships’
                        maneuvers, ships’ crew, and various types of sailing vessels, this trip was
                        probably not her first. The five-month voyage to and from Marseille followed
                        a typical north-Atlantic route from New York to southern France via the
                        Grand Banks of Newfoundland, the Azores, the Strait of Gibraltar, and the
                        western Mediterranean. Doane’s account of the voyage says nothing about the
                        business purpose of the trip; rather, she focuses on her life aboard ship
                        (playing with her pet cat, reading, sewing, cooking, cleaning, dealing with
                        seasickness) as well as the behavior of the ship’s crew and shipboard
                        discipline, all punctuated by accounts of weather, the ship’s progress, and
                        sightings of other ships.</p>
                     <p>Unlike the thousands of Americans who made the trip across the Atlantic in
                        the nineteenth century, bent on exploring fashionable European destinations
                        (Schriber 13, Stowe 3-15 ), Louisa Doane, accompanying her parents on a
                        commercial venture, was one of a number of women who were, as Mary Suzanne
                        Schriber puts it, "accidental tourists" (13). After a trying 54 days at sea,
                        Doane and her family spent just 23 days on the continent, throughout which
                        they remained in the busy seaport of Marseille. It is uncertain,
                        therefore, whether Doane would have looked forward to her time in Marseille
                        in the same way that other American travelers eagerly anticipated their
                        grand European tours. Her desire to reach Marseille, exhibited in her entry
                        for March 29, seems not to stem from the excitement of seeing new
                        places, but rather from an understandable longing to finally get off the
                        ship: "if this wind continues we shall get there tomorrow morning . . . 
                        Oh dear I hope we shall, for this is fifty two days at sea which is a long
                        passage, and I am quite tired."</p>
                     <p>Not surprisingly then, Doane's first entries upon arriving in Marseille
                        focus on food and lodging. She carefully describes their boarding house, and
                        provides long lists of what was served to them at mealtimes:</p>

                        and plentiful, and her accommodation was, as she notes, made of "stone"!</p>
                     <p>Later, taking advantage of medical care unavailable at sea, her father seeks

                        friends whose paths have crossed theirs in southern France, and make
                        frequent trips around the city on foot and horseback. After nearly a month in
                        port, the Doanes head home to New York.</p>
                     <p>A little over a month after their return, on August 5, 1852, the family
                        departs New York again on a second voyage, this time on the ship <name
                           type="ship">Commonwealth</name>, bound to Acapulco, Mexico and the
                        Chincha Islands off the coast of Peru, sailing south along the eastern coast
                        of South America, around Cape Horn, north to Acapulco, Mexico, back south to
                        Callao/Lima and the Chincha Islands off the coast of Pisco, Peru, then back
                        around Cape Horn to home, the entire voyage lasting over 14 months. For this
                        voyage, Louisa Doane adopts somewhat broader goals for her journal. She
                        begins by providing detailed information about the business arrangements for
                        the voyage:</p>

                              [<emph rend="italic">sic</emph>] on the Coast of Peru and load Guano

                     <p>Doane also commits herself to a more systematic approach to record-keeping,
                        blending her personal journal with aspects of a traditional ship’s log:</p>
                     <q rend="block">I shall now commence my Journal and endeavor to write every

                     <p>Though many of these elements appear in her journal, Doane doesn’t write as
                        regularly as she planned, and she leaves the story incomplete, stopping soon
                        after the <name type="ship">Commonwealth</name> crosses the equator heading
                        north on their voyage home. Still, Doane’s journal complements the story of
                        life at sea aboard merchant ships in the mid-nineteenth century told in many
                        journals from the period. In particular, she provides rich details about the
                        merchant fleet, the guano mining that drove traffic around Cape Horn,
                        violence and discipline aboard ship, and the risks and treatment of disease
                        on long voyages.</p>

                     <p>The <name type="ship">Commonwealth</name>’s voyage was chartered in part by
                        Howland and Aspinwall—pioneers of the maritime marine industry—and the
                        partnership of Foster and Nickerson, who were partial owners of the
                        Commonwealth. Howland and Aspinwall is credited with funding the
                        construction of innovative streamlined ship designs such as the <name
                           type="ship">Sea Witch</name>, which traveled from New York to China in a
                        record seventy-nine days in 1849. Records set by ships such as the <name
                           type="ship">Sea Witch</name> created a shipbuilding market driven by a
                        desire for faster transportation (Delgado 4), and led to competitions such as the "Deep
                        Sea Derby" race around Cape Horn in 1852 (the <name type="ship"
                           >Commonwealth</name> meets two of the ships involved in the derby, the
                           <name type="ship">Whirlwind</name> and the <name type="ship"
                           >Dauntless</name>). Readers can sense some of the interest generated by
                        these competitions in Louisa Doane’s frequent and flattering references to
                        clipper ships.</p>
                     <p>Doane notes several types of merchant vessels that the <name type="ship"
                           >Commonwealth</name> encounters: clipper ships, schooners, brigs,
                        barques, and packet ships under sail, as well as lighters, captain’s gig
                        boats, and other oar-powered craft used in port. However, Doane measures
                        other ships against clipper ships (once saying of the <name type="ship"
                           >Berlin</name>, “it is a fine Ship altho [<emph rend="italic">sic</emph>]
                        not a Clipper”), for she is sailing at the height of the American clipper
                        ship era, which extended roughly from 1820 to 1870 ("The Great Clippers"). The
                        range of clipper ship designs was so diverse that it is impossible to make
                        easy generalizations about their appearance—the term "clipper ship" was
                        applied to diverse ships designed to be very fast, and they often carried
                        very valuable items (Hittel). The
                        <name type="ship">Commonwealth</name> encounters several clipper ships—including the <name
                           type="ship">Whirlwind</name>, <name type="ship">Alboni</name>, and <name
                           type="ship">Louisa</name>—as they
                        were often used in their heyday on the long Cape Horn route linking the east
                        and west coasts of North America. Doane also records encounters with
                        schooners, barques, and brigs, whose different sail-plans and rigging she
                        apparently knew well enough to identify them on sight at sea. The <name
                           type="ship">Commonwealth</name> also encounters several steamers,
                        including the <name type="ship">Winfield Scott</name> and <name type="ship"
                           >Golden Gate</name>, for their voyage occurs during the long transition
                        from sail to steam and (later) diesel.</p>
                     <p>Speed aside, the primary concern for the master of any maritime vessel was
                        his responsibility for the ship and the ship's cargo (<title level="m">The
                           American Ship-Master's Daily Assistant</title> 1). According to maritime
                        laws, the master of the vessel remained responsible for all damages
                        occurring to cargo once aboard except for damages attributed to "an act of
                        God" or theft by piracy at sea. Any damage occurring due to poor ship
                        maintenance, theft occurring while at port, damage by the crew or sailors,
                        and even damage by rats was deemed the legal responsibility of the captain.
                        This responsibility shapes all aspects of life onboard, including ship
                        maintenance, crew discipline, and record-keeping, and is reflected in
                        Doane's repeated references to the ship's official documents (logs and
                        manifests), her notations of weather and conditions at sea, and her
                        documentation of port agents’ repeated embarkation and debarkation.</p>
                     <p rend="h3" xml:id="CapeHorn">“The long dreaded Place”</p>
                     <p>The <name type="ship">Commonwealth</name>’s voyage followed a particularly
                        storied route: Cape Horn holds a unique place in the lore and ritual of sea
                        travel. Standing at Latitude 55 degrees 59 minutes South and Longitude 67
                        degrees 16 minutes West, Cape Horn is the southernmost point of South
                        America. It marks the northern boundary of the Drake Passage, the 600-mile
                        stretch of ocean between the rocky island and Antarctica, which is commonly
                        considered the stormiest portion of ocean in the world. According to one
                        contemporary description, "The winds blow almost continuously from the west,
                        and although gales do not last so long in summer as in winter, they are more
                        frequent and stronger. . . . In short, navigation is nowhere more difficult
                        than in these waters” (Murphy 253). Nevertheless, in the immediate aftermath
                        of the California gold rush, the Drake Passage became a busy shipping lane.
                     </p>
                     <p>“Rounding the Horn”—traveling from 50 degrees South in the Atlantic to 50
                        degrees South in the Pacific—was and is a difficult, dangerous, and
                        time-consuming passage. However, at the time of Doane’s journey, sailing
                        around Cape Horn was the only way to “efficiently” move goods and people
                        between the Atlantic and the Pacific coasts of North America. There was no
                        naturally occurring break between North and South America from the Arctic
                        Circle all the way to Cape Horn. The transcontinental railroad would not be
                        completed until 1869, and the Panama Canal was not finished until 1914.</p>
                     <p>As the Commonwealth nears Cape Horn in early November on its westward trip
                        through the Drake Passage, Doane marks their approach to “The long dreaded
                        Place,” and, in company with several other ships, they round the Horn in
                        rough weather on their way to deliver coal in Acapulco before loading Guano
                        in the Chincha Islands of Peru.</p>
                     <p rend="h3" xml:id="GuanoMining">“The Island is a Solid Rock about 150 High
                        and the Guano is upon the top”</p>
                     <p>The Humboldt Current brings nutrient-rich water to the shores of Peru,
                        attracting anchovies and other fish, which in turn attract birds like
                        white-breasted cormorants, gray pelicans, and piqueros. The bird droppings,
                        rich in nitrate, collected in the vast deposits of guano that were mined in
                        the Chincha Islands for use as fertilizer. At its peak from around
                        1840-1880, the guano industry shipped upwards of 20 million tons, earning
                        Peru around two billion dollars in profits. However, the heyday of the
                        Chincha Islands guano industry did not last long. Resource depletion, wars,
                        and the development of alternative fertilizers would lead to a sharp decline
                        by the early decades of the twentieth century.</p>

                        men"</p>
                     <p>As noted above, Captains' wives, as well as wives of ship's labourers like
                        naval "boatswains, carpenters, and cooks," and even prostitutes would go to
                        sea, and were provided with abilities to actively contribute to seafaring
                        life (Cordingly, xi-xii), and many of their journals survive (Springer).
                        Personal diaries are often gendered as female, and in the Victorian period,
                        the diary enjoyed the distinction of being the "preeminent form of written
                        expression among women" (Springer 94). Yet the sea journals written by women
                        are somewhat of a hybrid form, as these diarists would often include, as
                        does Louisa Doane, elements typically included in a ship's log, a type of
                        writing "normally the province of men"—male sea captains (93). However,
                        Louisa Doane’s participation in navigation and record-keeping is not unique,
                        as the story of Mary Patten attests. In 1856, nineteen-year-old Mary Patten
                        left New York with her husband to sail to San Francisco. On a previous
                        voyage, she was "taught about the winds and tides," and her husband "showed
                        her how to calculate the ship's position with the aid of the sextant and the
                        chronometer, how to work out the correct course to steer, and how to keep a
                        daily record of the ship's progress in the logbook" (Cordingly 112). When he
                        collapsed while rounding Cape Horn, Patten, pregnant and with a crew on the
                        verge of mutiny, was able to direct the <name type="ship">Neptune's
                           Car</name> to San Francisco Bay. </p>
                     <p>Yet for all her attention to the details of navigation and ship’s rigging in
                        her journal, Doane’s life on the <name type="ship">Commonwealth</name> still
                        reflects conventional gender roles. Louisa and her mother cut out material
                        for a new dress, oversee the making of pancakes, "current [<emph
                           rend="italic">sic</emph>] jelly," mince pies, sausages and donuts, and
                        the washing of socks and handkerchiefs. As Haskell Springer suggests in
                           <title level="a">The Captain's Wife at Sea,</title> "even as they broke
                        with maritime tradition and went to sea, [captain's wives] found their lives
                        more closely approximating the prescribed strictures of separate male and
                        female spheres than did the women remaining ashore” (95). Doane and her
                        mother were also, of course, far outnumbered by men aboard the <name type="ship"
                           >Commonwealth</name>, which no doubt resulted in feelings of isolation.
                        Doane writes on March 30 of her excitement at seeing "two ladies on board" a

                        a primary trope in captain's wives’ journals. Imagine the relief even
                        further into the voyage, when the Doane women were "very much pleased to see
                        a Lady after being out 84 days and seeing nothing but men."</p>

                     <p>The class and gender hierarchies that would have structured Doane's life in
                        the mid-nineteenth century are further complicated by the already complex
                        power structures of a merchant ship like the <name type="ship"
                           >Commonwealth</name>. A woman in Doane's position would not have much
                        contact with most of the crew but would generally be on formal speaking
                        terms with only the "mates, steward, cook, and cabin boy" (Springer 95).
                        Doane and her mother's dealings with the steward and mates seem civil and
                        productive. They often work together cleaning the ship and performing tasks
                        for the general upkeep of the vessel, like preparing food, general nursing,
                        and preparing for storms. However, Doane also witnesses and records discord,
                        violence, and strict discipline aboard the ship.</p>
                     <p>Captains were expected to maintain shipboard discipline. <title level="m"
                           >Falconer's Dictionary of the Sea</title> enjoins them to</p>
                     <q rend="block">Shew a laudable example of honour and virtue to the officers
                           and men, and to discountenance all dissolute, immoral, and disorderly

                           subordination, as well as to correct those who are guilty of such
                           offences, as are punishable according to the usage of the sea. (Falconer,"Captain")</q>
                      <p>And, indeed, Louisa's father regularly enforces strict discipline: drunken sailors are
                        sent below decks; Captain Doane is called to quell a fight between the First
                        Mate and a sailor; having insulted the Captain with much "loud talk" after
                        refusing to scrape barnacles from the ship's hull, the Second Mate is made
                        to stand watch until he is willing to obey orders (a punishment which is
                        also doled out to another sailor). And on January 3, 1853, the Second Mate
                        flogs a sailor, despite the outcry against this practice in the decade from
                        1840-1850, until it was finally outlawed (Glenn, 408-409). The sailor
                        continues with his transgressions, goes on "talking very saucy to [Captain
                        Doane]" and was "then secured in Irons."</p>
                     <p>Louisa Doane reacts to some of the sailor's grievances with pity. When her
                        father rather cruelly upbraids a sailor for asking for more potatoes for the
                        sailors' beef, Doane "is most sorry for them." But food served as both a
                        privilege and a means of disciplining sailors aboard the <name type="ship"
                           >Commonwealth</name>. At one point, Doane witnesses sailors being denied
                        food for “misbehaving.” A sailor asks the captain if he thinks that the
                        ration of potatoes given to the crew is enough for six men, and the captain
                        responds by taking away all their potatoes as punishment for complaining
                        about their fare. In another incident, food figures in the punishment of
                        prisoners on board the <name type="ship">Commonwealth</name>:</p>
                     <q rend="block">The Prisoners are singing at a great rate and disturbing us

                     <p>Such discipline seems especially cruel, especially given the important role
                        that diet played aboard ship in preventing illnesses such as scurvy. Doane's
                        presence onboard provides us with both a first-person account of such strict
                        shipboard discipline a sympathetic view of the sailors' lot: "the poor
                        sailor looke beatten [<emph rend="italic">sic</emph>] and tired out and they

                     <p rend="h3" xml:id="Sickness">“a great deal of sickness”</p>
                     <p>Harsh discipline, rough weather, accidents, violence, diet, and infectious
                        disease all played a role in the prevalence of injury and illness aboard
                        ship, from seasickness, headache, bruises, broken bones, and “fits” to
                        scurvy, cholera, and Panama Fever.</p>
                     <p>Doane’s journal suggests that her father was the chief medical provider on
                        board, diagnosing and dispensing care often with the help of Doane and her
                        mother. Captain Doane's service as primary medical practitioner aboard the
                           <name type="ship">Commonwealth</name> points to the varied accessibility
                        to and quality of medical care available to sailors in the 19th century.
                        Naval sailors received higher quality and more consistent health care than
                        merchant marine sailors. As one contemporary commentator argued: "Money
                        would avail nothing to the public defence without a sufficient number of
                        able and healthy men, which are the real resources of a state, and the true
                        sinews of war" (Blane 151). By contrast, merchant mariners were seen as
                        replaceable, and therefore commercial ship owners experienced less economic
                        and moral pressure to maintain quality healthcare on board their ships. In
                        his examination of 19th century British merchant ships, G. C. Cook highlights
                        the perceived expendability of these sailors: "merchant seamen . . . lived a
                        most erratic existence—often being employed (frequently by ship owners who
                        were often unscrupulous) for a single voyage only" (225).</p>
                     <p>Doane’s account of sailors’ sickness seems to echo this situation. At one
                        point, Doane reports that Captain Doane believes sailors are "making
                        believe" that they are ill or "fained [<emph rend="italic">sic</emph>]
                        sick." Even when the captain acknowledges and treats a sailor’s illness,
                        concern for the sailor’s wellbeing seems secondary to the sailor’s ability
                        to perform his duties. Moreover, diagnosis and treatment of illnesses aboard
                        ship were limited by the medical practice of the time. For example, Doane
                        describes both kittens and sailors as having “fits.” James Ewell, in <title
                           level="m">The Planter's and Mariner's Medical Companion</title>, lists
                        four kinds of fits: apoplectic, epileptic, fainting, and hysteric. Fainting
                        and hysteric fits he assigned largely the province of women, while he views
                        apoplectic and epileptic fits as very dangerous, writing of apoplectic fits,
                        "In the cure of a disease, threatening such sudden fatality, remedies must
                        be speedily employed" (114). Although Louisa Doane does not seem to consider
                        one sailor's health in grave danger at the time of his fit, she asks her
                        parents for medical advice because the sailor is convinced that he "was
                        going to Die as he had the chills upon him." The Doanes' response is to take
                        the sailor's pulse and then reassure him that it is strong, and he has
                        little to worry about. Harold Langley, in a study of the early U.S. Navy,
                        notes that the pulse was considered an indicator of health and that "If the
                        pulse was slow or weak, the doctor concluded that the vascular fibers were
                        weak or lax. If the pulse was fast, the physician deduced that the vascular
                        fibers were hyperactive and that fever was present, for hyperactivity
                        produced heat" (31). Doane does not identify the medicine that her parents
                        dispense to the sailor, but it is likely that it was a purgative—either a
                        laxative or an emetic—since purging was considered to be the first course of
                        treatment when fevers were feared (Ewell 25), and cathartics (laxatives) and
                        emetics were among three of the most commonly-prescribed treatments for
                        ailments in the 19th century (Langley 31).</p>
                     <p>As we might expect, the medical care that the men received from Captain
                        Doane differs from that received by Doane and her father on shore—they are
                        treated by a dentist and a physician, respectively—though it is difficult to ascertain
                        whether their treatment was any more effective. Captain Doane is treated for
                        gout with a bread and milk poultice and an herbal bath in Marseilles; Doane
                        receives an herbal tea for a fever. Both of their conditions are monitored
                        closely and Doane reports that, had Captain Doane’s condition worsened, the
                        doctor would have "administered leeches." In any case, medical treatment on
                        land and in port was more consistent and higher quality for both ships’
                        passengers and sailors. Consuls were installed in foreign ports with whom
                        trade agreements had been signed to ensure that sick American sailors
                        received medical attention abroad (Langley 3).</p>
                     <p>Infectious diseases were of special concern because they spread easily
                        onboard ships and spread from ship to ship and ship to shore in harbors and
                        port cities, leading to the long-standing practice of quarantining ships
                        upon arrival in ports. The <name type="ship">Commonwealth</name> encounters
                        Scrofula, Cholera, and Panama Fever—a strain of influenza that caused fever,
                        nausea, vomiting, and dehydration—while in port in Acapulco: on one ship,
                        six people had already died from Panama Fever, and the <name type="ship"
                           >Winfield Scott</name> had lost fifteen passengers to illness. However,
                        the danger of infection does not prevent the captains of the ships anchored
                        at the Chincha Islands—and their families—from enjoy a seemingly daily round
                        of visits and dinners.</p>
                     <p rend="extraSpace">As noted above, Doane’s journal ends abruptly soon after
                        the <name type="ship">Commonwealth</name> “crossed the line” on its homeward
                        leg—despite the fact that her journal still contains fourteen blank pages.
                        Having avoided serious illness, survived a second “rounding of the Horn,”
                        and finding good weather in warmer latitudes—on October 13 at 4º50' N, she
                        writes “This is a pleasent day very warm”—perhaps nothing more “Occurs on
                        Board Worthy of Note” to Louisa Doane.</p>

         <projectDesc>
            <p>This edition belongs to a series of collaboratively produced electronic editions of
               previously unpublished nineteenth-century American manuscripts held in the Rare Books
               and Manuscripts Library (RBMS) at The Ohio State University Libraries. Other editions
               include "Selected Entries from the Lucius Clark Smith Diaries, 30 July 1862 to 31
               December 1862"; "My Dear Elizabeth," five letters written by Sophia Peabody Hawthorne
               to her sister Elizabeth Palmer Peabody between ca. 1837 and 1868; "Journal of a Tour
               to Europe," by Samuel Sullivan Cox; "Selected Letters from the Ivan S. Gilbert
               Collection of Stephens Family Travel Letters and Ephemera"; and "William B.
               Anderson's Civil War Correspondence, 1862-1864."</p>

            <p>Each text was initially edited in connection with an undergraduate or graduate course
               on electronic textual editing offered by H. Lewis Ulman, Associate Professor of
               English at The Ohio State University. The courses provided students with an
               opportunity to explore issues of textuality and mediation that arise when our
               cultural archives spread from page to screen and from library shelves to networked
               databases. Electronic textual editing served as each class's context for examining
               what happens—and envisioning what might happen—when artifacts in one medium are
               represented in another medium, especially with regard to the interpretive work of
               reading. Electronic textual editions also provided a contact zone that helped
               students reflect on what manuscript, print, and "born digital" artifacts can tell us
               about their unique properties and their relationships to one another.</p>

            <p>While the students' work focused on providing reliable textual editions, they also
               explored four threads inextricably woven into the work of electronic textual editing:
               the lives and historical milieu evoked by the texts; the history, characteristics,
               and preservation of physical and digital texts; the editorial processes and decisions
               that shape particular interpretations and presentations of texts; and the mediation of
               electronic delivery systems.</p>

            <p>These conceptual focuses, along with the time constraints of academic terms and the
               need to train students who had, typically, no prior experience in textual editing or
               the various technologies employed in electronic textual editing, strongly influenced
               the selection of texts in this series. Working with curators in the RBMS, Professor
               Ulman identified previously unpublished manuscript materials that were of potentially
               broad interest and that reflected a curatorial focus of the RBMS collection—for
               example, letters and personal diaries that connect private lives with larger
               historical contexts. Focusing on unique manuscript materials not, in all but one
               case, associated with other copies or later published versions also eliminated the
               need to compare multiple copies or states of the same work, perhaps held in other
               archives, an impractical task in the course of an academic term. Other practical
               matters also informed the choice of materials, including the possibility of scanning
               the source documents before the class so that students could work with both the
               original documents and high-resolutions facsimiles as they transcribed and encoded
               the source texts.</p>

            <p>Thus, the editions in this series are documentary editions—interpretations and
               representations of single documents—designed to provide wider exposure and access to
               manuscript materials that might otherwise be overlooked, and to provide users with a
               variety of tools for studying those texts.</p>

            <p> Over the course of several years following the classes in which students worked on
               the editions, Professor Ulman revised the introductory materials to ensure stylistic
               consistency and proofed the transcription and encoding. He also redesigned the
               structure of the editions to meet the requirements of Ohio State's institutional
               repository, evolving accessibility standards, and feedback from peer reviewers.
               However, he did not undertake a complete retranscription of the source text or
               wholesale revision of the students' introductory essays and annotations.</p>

            In addition to prose description, the Editorial Practices Declaration may contain 
            specialized elements concerned with correction, normalization, quotation, hyphenation,

            <p>
               <emph rend="bold">Scanning</emph>. The manuscript pages were scanned as 24-bit TIFF
               images at 400 dots per inch (dpi), then converted to 8-bit JPEG images at 400 dpi and
               full quality. All edges were overscanned by at least 1/4 inch. No color correction
               was used at any stage of image preparation, but a scan of a photographer's 18% grey
               card on the same scanner produced RGB values at the center of 91/95/107 after
               applying a 150% Gaussian Blur in Adobe Photoshop to average color values. Thus, a
               properly configured monitor should provide a reasonable approximation of colors on
               the manuscript pages.. </p>

            <p><emph rend="bold">Transcription</emph>. Editing of the Doane journal emphasizes
               diplomatic transcription: abbreviations, recoverable cancelations, punctuation,
               spelling, underlining, additions above and below the line or in the margins,
               capitalization, line breaks, and page breaks have all been transcribed and encoded as
               they appear in the original manuscripts. The representation of those features varies
               depending on the view of the letter. An explanation of the presentation in each view
               of the letters can be read via the "About this View" link at the top of each view's
               page.</p>

            <p><emph rend="bold">Markup and Annotation</emph>. XML encoding of the Doane journal
               follows The Text Encoding Initiative's (TEI) <title level="m">P5: Guidelines for
                  Electronic Text Encoding and Interchange</title>, as customized for the project
               using the TEI's ODD ("One Document Does it All") process. This editorial introduction
               and the three "views" of the letters were generated from the main XML file using XSL
               transformations to produce HTML Web pages. Several of the appendices were encoded in
               HTML separately. A more detailed description of the markup can be found via the
               "Appendices" menu, and all source files (XML, XSL, CSS, ODD, RNC) can be viewed and
               downloaded via the "Source Files" menu.</p>

            <p>Introductory material (such as this editorial introduction) as well as annotated
               lists of people and places mentioned in the letters are
               encoded in the TEI header of the main XML document. Other explanatory annotations are
               linked directly from the text. Separate appendices provide further information about
               the project (e.g., acknowledgements, editors' bios, and so on). All these ancillary
               materials can be viewed via the menus at the top of each page.</p>

               <emph rend="bold">Proofing</emph>. Students who created the original transcriptions
               proofread their own transcription and encoding. In preparation for peer review by
               NINES and preservation in The Ohio State University's Knowledge Bank, the
               transcriptions and encoding were once again proofread by Professor Ulman. </p>
            <p>
               <emph rend="bold">Peer Review</emph>. Anonymous reviewers for NINES provided
               peer-reviews for the editions, in response to which they were revised and then

               <emph rend="bold">Markup of Physical Structure and Page Layout</emph>. The manuscript
                  <emph rend="bold">pages</emph>, encoded by the empty page break or &lt;pb/&gt;
               element, are the primary physical structures represented in the markup. Each
               &lt;pb&gt; element includes an &quot;mmid&quot; attribute identifying the unique ID
               of a high-resolution scan of that image in the Media Manager application, as well as
               &quot;audiostart&quot; and &quot;audioend&quot; attributes that identify the section
               of the audio edition that corresponds to that page. <emph rend="bold">Line
                  breaks</emph> (i.e., lineation determined or influenced by the physical
               constraints of the page rather than compositional choices by the author) are encoded
               with the empty &lt;lb/&gt; element. No attributes are included in the &lt;lb&gt;
               element. </p>
            <p>
               <emph rend="bold">Markup of Textual Structure</emph>. The <emph rend="bold">journal
                  entry</emph>, encoded by a &lt;div1&gt; element with the attribute-value pair
               &quot;type='Entry'&quot;, constitutes the primary textual structure represented in
               the markup. Each entry contains an &lt;opener&gt; element—which in turn contains a
               &lt;dateline&gt; element—and one or more paragraphs. Each dateline may include a
               &lt;name&gt; element with (optionally) a &quot;type&quot; attribute containing one of
               the following values: city, region; and a &lt;date&gt; element with a
               &quot;value&quot; attribute whose value is in the form YYYY-MM-DD. The &lt;div1&gt;
               elements also contain &quot;audiostart&quot; and &quot;audioend&quot; elements that
               identify the section of the audio edition that corresponds to that entry. </p>
            <p>Entries consist of a series of <emph rend="bold">paragraphs</emph>. Where indicated
               by indentation of a line from the left margin of a page, line breaks part-way across
               a page, or additional white space between lines, paragraphs are encoded with the
               &lt;p&gt; element and no attributes. </p>
            <p>If present, any prefatory text preceding the dateline may be encoded as a
               &lt;head&gt; element at the beginning of the entry (i.e., within the
               &lt;div&gt;element and before the &lt;opener&gt;). </p>
            <p>
               <emph rend="bold">Level of Transcription/Encoding</emph>. This markup scheme supports
               a modest range of presentations, from semi-modernized/corrected to semi-diplomatic.
               The basic transcription follows the manuscript verbatim. Various manuscript features
               (e.g., cancellations, interlinear or marginal additions, tears in pages) are encoded,
               as are regularized versions of proper names and dates and standard versions of
               nonstandard spellings and expansions of abbreviations. </p>

                        France</title> (1867). Commenting on the layout of the city, rising on hills
                     around the port, he says the following: "From this disposition of the ground,
                     the port becomes the sewer of the city, the receptacle of all its filth,
                     stagnating in a tideless sea and under a burning sun, until a S. E. wind
                     produces that circulation in its waters which the tide would do on other seas.
                     The stench emanating from it at times is consequently intolerable, except for
                     natives; and dredging machines require to be constantly employed to cleanse it"

                     to the man suffering from scurvy is indicative of the larger debate in the
                     mid-19th century about the causes and prevention of scurvy. Although it was
                     widely accepted that lime and other citrus juices were preventive agents,
                     sailors were said to be reluctant to drink the juice. A series of letters to
                     the editor of the <title level="j">London Times</title> in 1866 reveals the
                     alternative preventives proposed by many doctors; significantly, "fresh
                     succulent vegetables" as well as potatoes and "preserved potatoes" were thought
                     to be a successful alternative that presented an easier pill for sailors to

                     College of Virginia, describes in detail the history and uses of quinine. The
                     medicine was made from a bitter alkaloid found in cinchona bark. In the 19th
                     century, quinine was used to not only dispel fever, but also to treat pain and
                     swelling caused by malarial infections. Manson describes in detail the effects
                     of quinine on a patient: "I gave him twenty grains of quinine . . . and next
                     morning, on awaking, the pain had vanished, and the inflammation of the muscles
                     of the jaw and general swelling of the face had diminished to such a degree
                     that he could eat his breakfast" <bibl><ref target="#Manson">41</ref></bibl>

                     American and English vessels engaged in the extensive whale fisheries of the
                     Pacific have . . . put into the commodious harbor which there is in one of the

                     fate which many white men have received at their hands, has deterred their
                     crews from intermixing with the population sufficiently to gain any insight in

                     those without 'shortening' of butter or lard, are simply flour and water worked
                     into a tough dough and baked instead of being air or sun dried as macaroni and
                     vermicelli are. They are usually made of northern grown wheat, containing more

                     Pilot bread is used not only as a diet staple but also as a remedy for
                     seasickness: "Now, if you will just nibble pilot's-bread for a day, and sip
                     champagne—a table-spoonful at a dose—you will probably escape. Seasickness is
