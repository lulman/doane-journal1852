         <h2 id="introduction">“Whatever Occurs on Board Worthy of Note”</h2>
         <hr>
         
         <p>On Friday, February 6, 1852, sixteen-year-old Louisa Doane and her mother,
            Almira, set sail from New York in a merchant ship bound for Marseille,
            France and commanded by her father, Edmund N. Doane. It was not unusual for
            captains’ wives and children to accompany them on long voyages (“Families at
            Sea: the Captain’s Wife”; Druett 90), and judging from Louisa Doane’s familiarity with
            ships’ rigging, winds at sea, measurements of latitude and longitude, ships’
            maneuvers, ships’ crew, and various types of sailing vessels, this trip was
            probably not her first. The five-month voyage to and from Marseille followed
            a typical north-Atlantic route from New York to southern France via the
            Grand Banks of Newfoundland, the Azores, the Strait of Gibraltar, and the
            western Mediterranean. Doane’s account of the voyage says nothing about the
            business purpose of the trip; rather, she focuses on her life aboard ship
            (playing with her pet cat, reading, sewing, cooking, cleaning, dealing with
            seasickness) as well as the behavior of the ship’s crew and shipboard
            discipline, all punctuated by accounts of weather, the ship’s progress, and
            sightings of other ships.</p>
         
         <p>Unlike the thousands of Americans who made the trip across the Atlantic in
            the nineteenth century, bent on exploring fashionable European destinations
            (Schriber 13, Stowe 3-15 ), Louisa Doane, accompanying her parents on a
            commercial venture, was one of a number of women who were, as Mary Suzanne
            Schriber puts it, "accidental tourists" (13). After a trying 54 days at sea,
            Doane and her family spent just 23 days on the continent, throughout which
            they remained in the busy seaport of Marseille. It is uncertain,
            therefore, whether Doane would have looked forward to her time in Marseille
            in the same way that other American travelers eagerly anticipated their
            grand European tours. Her desire to reach Marseille, exhibited in her entry
            for March 29, seems not to stem from the excitement of seeing new
            places, but rather from an understandable longing to finally get off the
            ship: "if this wind continues we shall get there tomorrow morning .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. 
            Oh dear I hope we shall, for this is fifty two days at sea which is a long
            passage, and I am quite tired."</p>
         
         <p>Not surprisingly then, Doane's first entries upon arriving in Marseille
            focus on food and lodging. She carefully describes their boarding house, and
            provides long lists of what was served to them at mealtimes:</p>
         
         <div class="blockquote">I will now tell you what we had for dinner, beef soup rost
            turkey, rost beef, boiled lamb, stew[ed] chickens, potatoes, and spinage,
            for desert [<span style="font-style:italic">sic</span>] pie, oranges, apples, pears,
            figs, for tea we had preserved beef. boiled ham, fresh pork. white bread.
            butter. olives. stew[ed] pears. frosted cake. and then the fruit as we
            had at dinner think. we shall like [it] very much.<br></div>
         
         <p>The extent to which she documents these details suggest the sense of joy
            that must have accompanied her arrival on dry land, where food was varied
            and plentiful, and her accommodation was, as she notes, made of "stone"!</p>
         
         <p>Later, taking advantage of medical care unavailable at sea, her father seeks
            treatment for gout, and she sees a dentist</p>
         
         <div class="blockquote">to have my teeth filled, he first claned [sic] my teeth,
            took all the tarter [<span style="font-style:italic">sic</span>] off. he said I had
            one tooth that must be filled, and two that the nerve must be killed,
            they was [<span style="font-style:italic">sic</span>] too far gone to [be] filled,
            but he could kill the nerve so they would never trouble me<br></div>
         
         <p>During their stay in Marseille, the Doanes also socialize with seafaring
            friends whose paths have crossed theirs in southern France, and make
            frequent trips around the city on foot and horseback. After nearly a month in
            port, the Doanes head home to New York.</p>
         
         <p>A little over a month after their return, on August 5, 1852, the family
            departs New York again on a second voyage, this time on the ship <span style="font-style:italic">Commonwealth</span>, bound to Acapulco, Mexico and the
            Chincha Islands off the coast of Peru, sailing south along the eastern coast
            of South America, around Cape Horn, north to Acapulco, Mexico, back south to
            Callao/Lima and the Chincha Islands off the coast of Pisco, Peru, then back
            around Cape Horn to home, the entire voyage lasting over 14 months. For this
            voyage, Louisa Doane adopts somewhat broader goals for her journal. She
            begins by providing detailed information about the business arrangements for
            the voyage:</p>
         
         <div class="blockquote">The Ship is chartered by Howland &amp; Aspinwall to load
            with Coal at the Port and go to Acapulco and discharge the Coal. She is
            then chartered by Mr Bennet to proceed from thence to Lobes Islands
            [<span style="font-style:italic">sic</span>] on the Coast of Peru and load Guano
            and return to Hampden Roads [<span style="font-style:italic">sic</span>] for orders
            whether to proceed to Boston New York or Baltimore to discharge<br></div>
         
         <div class="blockquote">The Ship is partly owned by Messers Foster &amp; Nickerson
            is 650 Tons and is about Two years old and has good accomadation [<span style="font-style:italic">sic</span>] for us<br></div>
         
         <div class="blockquote"> My Father is to command the Ship my mother is a-going with
            with [<span style="font-style:italic">sic</span>] us my Uncle William Thacher is to
            go the Voyage as one of the sailors and all the others of the Ships
            company is Strangers<br></div>
         
         <div class="blockquote">My Father
            and Uncle S M Nickerson has bought a Piano which cost $289, with the
            Stool and Cover my Father pays for one half and Uncle the other and they
            have set it up in the Cabin and they say I shall be welcome to the use of
            it on the passage out to Acapulco or to the Lobes Island [<span style="font-style:italic">sic</span>] and then Father is to sell it if he can and
            invest the procced [<span style="font-style:italic">sic</span>] in Hides or Horns or
            any thing he thinks best and bring them to New York and sell them. he
            agrees to not charge any freight on either the Piano or whatever he
            invest the proceeds in. he then agrees to divide the profit or loss on
            the Piano or whatever the proceeds is invested in equal with Uncle
            Sparrow <br></div>
         
         <p>Doane also commits herself to a more systematic approach to record-keeping,
            blending her personal journal with aspects of a traditional ship’s log:</p>
         
         <div class="blockquote">I shall now commence my Journal and endeavor to write every
            day at 12 oclock M and give a discription [<span style="font-style:italic">sic</span>] of our Voyage record the distance we run every day the
            changes of wind and weather and whatever occurs on board worthy of note
            and the time of arriving and leaving our Port of destination<br></div>
         
         <p>Though many of these elements appear in her journal, Doane doesn’t write as
            regularly as she planned, and she leaves the story incomplete, stopping soon
            after the <span style="font-style:italic">Commonwealth</span> crosses the equator heading
            north on their voyage home. Still, Doane’s journal complements the story of
            life at sea aboard merchant ships in the mid-nineteenth century told in many
            journals from the period. In particular, she provides rich details about the
            merchant fleet, the guano mining that drove traffic around Cape Horn,
            violence and discipline aboard ship, and the risks and treatment of disease
            on long voyages.</p>
         
         <h3 id="MaritimeMarine">“The Ship is chartered by Howland &amp;
            Aspinwall”</h3>
         
         <p>The <span style="font-style:italic">Commonwealth</span>’s voyage was chartered in part by
            Howland and Aspinwall—pioneers of the maritime marine industry—and the
            partnership of Foster and Nickerson, who were partial owners of the
            Commonwealth. Howland and Aspinwall is credited with funding the
            construction of innovative streamlined ship designs such as the <span style="font-style:italic">Sea Witch</span>, which traveled from New York to China in a
            record seventy-nine days in 1849. Records set by ships such as the <span style="font-style:italic">Sea Witch</span> created a shipbuilding market driven by a
            desire for faster transportation (Delgado 4), and led to competitions such as the "Deep
            Sea Derby" race around Cape Horn in 1852 (the <span style="font-style:italic">Commonwealth</span> meets two of the ships involved in the derby, the
            <span style="font-style:italic">Whirlwind</span> and the <span style="font-style:italic">Dauntless</span>). Readers can sense some of the interest generated by
            these competitions in Louisa Doane’s frequent and flattering references to
            clipper ships.</p>
         
         <p>Doane notes several types of merchant vessels that the <span style="font-style:italic">Commonwealth</span> encounters: clipper ships, schooners, brigs,
            barques, and packet ships under sail, as well as lighters, captain’s gig
            boats, and other oar-powered craft used in port. However, Doane measures
            other ships against clipper ships (once saying of the <span style="font-style:italic">Berlin</span>, “it is a fine Ship altho [<span style="font-style:italic">sic</span>]
            not a Clipper”), for she is sailing at the height of the American clipper
            ship era, which extended roughly from 1820 to 1870 ("The Great Clippers"). The
            range of clipper ship designs was so diverse that it is impossible to make
            easy generalizations about their appearance—the term "clipper ship" was
            applied to diverse ships designed to be very fast, and they often carried
            very valuable items (Hittel). The
            <span style="font-style:italic">Commonwealth</span> encounters several clipper ships—including the <span style="font-style:italic">Whirlwind</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">Alboni</span>, and <span style="font-style:italic">Louisa</span>—as they
            were often used in their heyday on the long Cape Horn route linking the east
            and west coasts of North America. Doane also records encounters with
            schooners, barques, and brigs, whose different sail-plans and rigging she
            apparently knew well enough to identify them on sight at sea. The <span style="font-style:italic">Commonwealth</span> also encounters several steamers,
            including the <span style="font-style:italic">Winfield Scott</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Golden Gate</span>, for their voyage occurs during the long transition
            from sail to steam and (later) diesel.</p>
         
         <p>Speed aside, the primary concern for the master of any maritime vessel was
            his responsibility for the ship and the ship's cargo (<cite>The
               American Ship-Master's Daily Assistant</cite> 1). According to maritime
            laws, the master of the vessel remained responsible for all damages
            occurring to cargo once aboard except for damages attributed to "an act of
            God" or theft by piracy at sea. Any damage occurring due to poor ship
            maintenance, theft occurring while at port, damage by the crew or sailors,
            and even damage by rats was deemed the legal responsibility of the captain.
            This responsibility shapes all aspects of life onboard, including ship
            maintenance, crew discipline, and record-keeping, and is reflected in
            Doane's repeated references to the ship's official documents (logs and
            manifests), her notations of weather and conditions at sea, and her
            documentation of port agents’ repeated embarkation and debarkation.</p>
         
         <h3 id="CapeHorn">“The long dreaded Place”</h3>
         
         <p>The <span style="font-style:italic">Commonwealth</span>’s voyage followed a particularly
            storied route: Cape Horn holds a unique place in the lore and ritual of sea
            travel. Standing at Latitude 55 degrees 59 minutes South and Longitude 67
            degrees 16 minutes West, Cape Horn is the southernmost point of South
            America. It marks the northern boundary of the Drake Passage, the 600-mile
            stretch of ocean between the rocky island and Antarctica, which is commonly
            considered the stormiest portion of ocean in the world. According to one
            contemporary description, "The winds blow almost continuously from the west,
            and although gales do not last so long in summer as in winter, they are more
            frequent and stronger. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. In short, navigation is nowhere more difficult
            than in these waters” (Murphy 253). Nevertheless, in the immediate aftermath
            of the California gold rush, the Drake Passage became a busy shipping lane.
            </p>
         
         <p>“Rounding the Horn”—traveling from 50 degrees South in the Atlantic to 50
            degrees South in the Pacific—was and is a difficult, dangerous, and
            time-consuming passage. However, at the time of Doane’s journey, sailing
            around Cape Horn was the only way to “efficiently” move goods and people
            between the Atlantic and the Pacific coasts of North America. There was no
            naturally occurring break between North and South America from the Arctic
            Circle all the way to Cape Horn. The transcontinental railroad would not be
            completed until 1869, and the Panama Canal was not finished until 1914.</p>
         
         <p>As the Commonwealth nears Cape Horn in early November on its westward trip
            through the Drake Passage, Doane marks their approach to “The long dreaded
            Place,” and, in company with several other ships, they round the Horn in
            rough weather on their way to deliver coal in Acapulco before loading Guano
            in the Chincha Islands of Peru.</p>
         
         <h3 id="GuanoMining">“The Island is a Solid Rock about 150 High
            and the Guano is upon the top”</h3>
         
         <p>The Humboldt Current brings nutrient-rich water to the shores of Peru,
            attracting anchovies and other fish, which in turn attract birds like
            white-breasted cormorants, gray pelicans, and piqueros. The bird droppings,
            rich in nitrate, collected in the vast deposits of guano that were mined in
            the Chincha Islands for use as fertilizer. At its peak from around
            1840-1880, the guano industry shipped upwards of 20 million tons, earning
            Peru around two billion dollars in profits. However, the heyday of the
            Chincha Islands guano industry did not last long. Resource depletion, wars,
            and the development of alternative fertilizers would lead to a sharp decline
            by the early decades of the twentieth century.</p>
         
         <h3 id="NothingButMen">“out 84 days and seeing nothing but
            men"</h3>
         
         <p>As noted above, Captains' wives, as well as wives of ship's labourers like
            naval "boatswains, carpenters, and cooks," and even prostitutes would go to
            sea, and were provided with abilities to actively contribute to seafaring
            life (Cordingly, xi-xii), and many of their journals survive (Springer).
            Personal diaries are often gendered as female, and in the Victorian period,
            the diary enjoyed the distinction of being the "preeminent form of written
            expression among women" (Springer 94). Yet the sea journals written by women
            are somewhat of a hybrid form, as these diarists would often include, as
            does Louisa Doane, elements typically included in a ship's log, a type of
            writing "normally the province of men"—male sea captains (93). However,
            Louisa Doane’s participation in navigation and record-keeping is not unique,
            as the story of Mary Patten attests. In 1856, nineteen-year-old Mary Patten
            left New York with her husband to sail to San Francisco. On a previous
            voyage, she was "taught about the winds and tides," and her husband "showed
            her how to calculate the ship's position with the aid of the sextant and the
            chronometer, how to work out the correct course to steer, and how to keep a
            daily record of the ship's progress in the logbook" (Cordingly 112). When he
            collapsed while rounding Cape Horn, Patten, pregnant and with a crew on the
            verge of mutiny, was able to direct the Neptune's
            Car to San Francisco Bay. </p>
         
         <p>Yet for all her attention to the details of navigation and ship’s rigging in
            her journal, Doane’s life on the <span style="font-style:italic">Commonwealth</span> still
            reflects conventional gender roles. Louisa and her mother cut out material
            for a new dress, oversee the making of pancakes, "current [<span style="font-style:italic">sic</span>] jelly," mince pies, sausages and donuts, and
            the washing of socks and handkerchiefs. As Haskell Springer suggests in
            "The Captain's Wife at Sea," "even as they broke
            with maritime tradition and went to sea, [captain's wives] found their lives
            more closely approximating the prescribed strictures of separate male and
            female spheres than did the women remaining ashore” (95). Doane and her
            mother were also, of course, far outnumbered by men aboard the <span style="font-style:italic">Commonwealth</span>, which no doubt resulted in feelings of isolation.
            Doane writes on March 30 of her excitement at seeing "two ladies on board" a
            passing ship, "which was quite a rarty to to [<span style="font-style:italic">sic</span>] us, as we have been out forty three days, and have seen nothing
            but sky and water, and a great deal of ruff [<span style="font-style:italic">sic</span>] weather." Springer identifies this "longing for other women" as
            a primary trope in captain's wives’ journals. Imagine the relief even
            further into the voyage, when the Doane women were "very much pleased to see
            a Lady after being out 84 days and seeing nothing but men."</p>
         
         <h3 id="Discipline">“Father then put him in irons”</h3>
         
         <p>The class and gender hierarchies that would have structured Doane's life in
            the mid-nineteenth century are further complicated by the already complex
            power structures of a merchant ship like the <span style="font-style:italic">Commonwealth</span>. A woman in Doane's position would not have much
            contact with most of the crew but would generally be on formal speaking
            terms with only the "mates, steward, cook, and cabin boy" (Springer 95).
            Doane and her mother's dealings with the steward and mates seem civil and
            productive. They often work together cleaning the ship and performing tasks
            for the general upkeep of the vessel, like preparing food, general nursing,
            and preparing for storms. However, Doane also witnesses and records discord,
            violence, and strict discipline aboard the ship.</p>
         
         <p>Captains were expected to maintain shipboard discipline. <cite>Falconer's Dictionary of the Sea</cite> enjoins them to</p>
         
         <div class="blockquote">Shew a laudable example of honour and virtue to the officers
            and men, and to discountenance all dissolute, immoral, and disorderly
            practices, and such as are contrary to the rules of discipline and
            subordination, as well as to correct those who are guilty of such
            offences, as are punishable according to the usage of the sea. (Falconer,"Captain")<br></div>
         
         <p>And, indeed, Louisa's father regularly enforces strict discipline: drunken sailors
            are
            sent below decks; Captain Doane is called to quell a fight between the First
            Mate and a sailor; having insulted the Captain with much "loud talk" after
            refusing to scrape barnacles from the ship's hull, the Second Mate is made
            to stand watch until he is willing to obey orders (a punishment which is
            also doled out to another sailor). And on January 3, 1853, the Second Mate
            flogs a sailor, despite the outcry against this practice in the decade from
            1840-1850, until it was finally outlawed (Glenn, 408-409). The sailor
            continues with his transgressions, goes on "talking very saucy to [Captain
            Doane]" and was "then secured in Irons."</p>
         
         <p>Louisa Doane reacts to some of the sailor's grievances with pity. When her
            father rather cruelly upbraids a sailor for asking for more potatoes for the
            sailors' beef, Doane "is most sorry for them." But food served as both a
            privilege and a means of disciplining sailors aboard the <span style="font-style:italic">Commonwealth</span>. At one point, Doane witnesses sailors being denied
            food for “misbehaving.” A sailor asks the captain if he thinks that the
            ration of potatoes given to the crew is enough for six men, and the captain
            responds by taking away all their potatoes as punishment for complaining
            about their fare. In another incident, food figures in the punishment of
            prisoners on board the <span style="font-style:italic">Commonwealth</span>:</p>
         
         <div class="blockquote">The Prisoners are singing at a great rate and disturbing us
            very much [.] When Father [ordered?] them to stop which they did but gave
            him a very saucy reply, then Father [ordered?] the Second Mate not to
            give them but half a bread apiece for their suppers[.]<br></div>
         
         <p>Such discipline seems especially cruel, especially given the important role
            that diet played aboard ship in preventing illnesses such as scurvy. Doane's
            presence onboard provides us with both a first-person account of such strict
            shipboard discipline a sympathetic view of the sailors' lot: "the poor

         <h3 id="Sickness">“a great deal of sickness”</h3>
         
         <p>Harsh discipline, rough weather, accidents, violence, diet, and infectious
            disease all played a role in the prevalence of injury and illness aboard
            ship, from seasickness, headache, bruises, broken bones, and “fits” to
            scurvy, cholera, and Panama Fever.</p>
         
         <p>Doane’s journal suggests that her father was the chief medical provider on
            board, diagnosing and dispensing care often with the help of Doane and her
            mother. Captain Doane's service as primary medical practitioner aboard the
            <span style="font-style:italic">Commonwealth</span> points to the varied accessibility
            to and quality of medical care available to sailors in the 19th century.
            Naval sailors received higher quality and more consistent health care than
            merchant marine sailors. As one contemporary commentator argued: "Money
            would avail nothing to the public defence without a sufficient number of
            able and healthy men, which are the real resources of a state, and the true
            sinews of war" (Blane 151). By contrast, merchant mariners were seen as
            replaceable, and therefore commercial ship owners experienced less economic
            and moral pressure to maintain quality healthcare on board their ships. In
            his examination of 19th century British merchant ships, G.&nbsp;C. Cook highlights
            the perceived expendability of these sailors: "merchant seamen . . . lived a
            most erratic existence—often being employed (frequently by ship owners who
            were often unscrupulous) for a single voyage only" (225).</p>
         
         <p>Doane’s account of sailors’ sickness seems to echo this situation. At one
            point, Doane reports that Captain Doane believes sailors are "making
            believe" that they are ill or "fained [<span style="font-style:italic">sic</span>]
            sick." Even when the captain acknowledges and treats a sailor’s illness,
            concern for the sailor’s wellbeing seems secondary to the sailor’s ability
            to perform his duties. Moreover, diagnosis and treatment of illnesses aboard
            ship were limited by the medical practice of the time. For example, Doane
            describes both kittens and sailors as having “fits.” James Ewell, in <cite>The Planter's and Mariner's Medical Companion</cite>, lists
            four kinds of fits: apoplectic, epileptic, fainting, and hysteric. Fainting
            and hysteric fits he assigned largely the province of women, while he views
            apoplectic and epileptic fits as very dangerous, writing of apoplectic fits,
            "In the cure of a disease, threatening such sudden fatality, remedies must
            be speedily employed" (114). Although Louisa Doane does not seem to consider
            one sailor's health in grave danger at the time of his fit, she asks her
            parents for medical advice because the sailor is convinced that he "was
            going to Die as he had the chills upon him." The Doanes' response is to take
            the sailor's pulse and then reassure him that it is strong, and he has
            little to worry about. Harold Langley, in a study of the early U.S. Navy,
            notes that the pulse was considered an indicator of health and that "If the
            pulse was slow or weak, the doctor concluded that the vascular fibers were
            weak or lax. If the pulse was fast, the physician deduced that the vascular
            fibers were hyperactive and that fever was present, for hyperactivity
            produced heat" (31). Doane does not identify the medicine that her parents
            dispense to the sailor, but it is likely that it was a purgative—either a
            laxative or an emetic—since purging was considered to be the first course of
            treatment when fevers were feared (Ewell 25), and cathartics (laxatives) and
            emetics were among three of the most commonly-prescribed treatments for
            ailments in the 19th century (Langley 31).</p>
         
         <p>As we might expect, the medical care that the men received from Captain
            Doane differs from that received by Doane and her father on shore—they are
            treated by a dentist and a physician, respectively—though it is difficult to ascertain
            whether their treatment was any more effective. Captain Doane is treated for
            gout with a bread and milk poultice and an herbal bath in Marseilles; Doane
            receives an herbal tea for a fever. Both of their conditions are monitored
            closely and Doane reports that, had Captain Doane’s condition worsened, the
            doctor would have "administered leeches." In any case, medical treatment on
            land and in port was more consistent and higher quality for both ships’
            passengers and sailors. Consuls were installed in foreign ports with whom
            trade agreements had been signed to ensure that sick American sailors
            received medical attention abroad (Langley 3).</p>
         
         <p>Infectious diseases were of special concern because they spread easily
            onboard ships and spread from ship to ship and ship to shore in harbors and
            port cities, leading to the long-standing practice of quarantining ships
            upon arrival in ports. The <span style="font-style:italic">Commonwealth</span> encounters
            Scrofula, Cholera, and Panama Fever—a strain of influenza that caused fever,
            nausea, vomiting, and dehydration—while in port in Acapulco: on one ship,
            six people had already died from Panama Fever, and the <span style="font-style:italic">Winfield Scott</span> had lost fifteen passengers to illness. However,
            the danger of infection does not prevent the captains of the ships anchored
            at the Chincha Islands—and their families—from enjoy a seemingly daily round
            of visits and dinners.</p>
         
         <p style="margin-top:2em">As noted above, Doane’s journal ends abruptly soon after
            the <span style="font-style:italic">Commonwealth</span> “crossed the line” on its homeward
            leg—despite the fact that her journal still contains fourteen blank pages.
            Having avoided serious illness, survived a second “rounding of the Horn,”
            and finding good weather in warmer latitudes—on October 13 at 4º50' N, she
            writes “This is a pleasent day very warm”—perhaps nothing more “Occurs on
            Board Worthy of Note” to Louisa Doane.</p>

         <p>This edition belongs to a series of collaboratively produced electronic editions of
            previously unpublished nineteenth-century American manuscripts held in the Rare Books
            and Manuscripts Library (RBMS) at The Ohio State University Libraries. Other editions
            include "Selected Entries from the Lucius Clark Smith Diaries, 30 July 1862 to 31
            December 1862"; "My Dear Elizabeth," five letters written by Sophia Peabody Hawthorne
            to her sister Elizabeth Palmer Peabody between ca. 1837 and 1868; "Journal of a Tour
            to Europe," by Samuel Sullivan Cox; "Selected Letters from the Ivan S. Gilbert
            Collection of Stephens Family Travel Letters and Ephemera"; and "William B.
            Anderson's Civil War Correspondence, 1862-1864."</p>
         
         
         <p>Each text was initially edited in connection with an undergraduate or graduate course
            on electronic textual editing offered by H. Lewis Ulman, Associate Professor of
            English at The Ohio State University. The courses provided students with an
            opportunity to explore issues of textuality and mediation that arise when our
            cultural archives spread from page to screen and from library shelves to networked
            databases. Electronic textual editing served as each class's context for examining
            what happens—and envisioning what might happen—when artifacts in one medium are
            represented in another medium, especially with regard to the interpretive work of
            reading. Electronic textual editions also provided a contact zone that helped
            students reflect on what manuscript, print, and "born digital" artifacts can tell
            us
            about their unique properties and their relationships to one another.</p>
         
         
         <p>While the students' work focused on providing reliable textual editions, they also
            explored four threads inextricably woven into the work of electronic textual editing:
            the lives and historical milieu evoked by the texts; the history, characteristics,
            and preservation of physical and digital texts; the editorial processes and decisions
            that shape particular interpretations and presentations of texts; and the mediation
            of
            electronic delivery systems.</p>
         
         
         <p>These conceptual focuses, along with the time constraints of academic terms and the
            need to train students who had, typically, no prior experience in textual editing
            or
            the various technologies employed in electronic textual editing, strongly influenced
            the selection of texts in this series. Working with curators in the RBMS, Professor
            Ulman identified previously unpublished manuscript materials that were of potentially
            broad interest and that reflected a curatorial focus of the RBMS collection—for
            example, letters and personal diaries that connect private lives with larger
            historical contexts. Focusing on unique manuscript materials not, in all but one
            case, associated with other copies or later published versions also eliminated the
            need to compare multiple copies or states of the same work, perhaps held in other
            archives, an impractical task in the course of an academic term. Other practical
            matters also informed the choice of materials, including the possibility of scanning
            the source documents before the class so that students could work with both the
            original documents and high-resolutions facsimiles as they transcribed and encoded
            the source texts.</p>
         
         
         <p>Thus, the editions in this series are documentary editions—interpretations and
            representations of single documents—designed to provide wider exposure and access
            to
            manuscript materials that might otherwise be overlooked, and to provide users with
            a
            variety of tools for studying those texts.</p>
         
         
         <p> Over the course of several years following the classes in which students worked on
            the editions, Professor Ulman revised the introductory materials to ensure stylistic
            consistency and proofed the transcription and encoding. He also redesigned the
            structure of the editions to meet the requirements of Ohio State's institutional
            repository, evolving accessibility standards, and feedback from peer reviewers.
            However, he did not undertake a complete retranscription of the source text or
            wholesale revision of the students' introductory essays and annotations.</p>

         <hr>
         
         <p>
            <strong>Scanning</strong>. The manuscript pages were scanned as 24-bit TIFF
            images at 400 dots per inch (dpi), then converted to 8-bit JPEG images at 400 dpi
            and
            full quality. All edges were overscanned by at least 1/4 inch. No color correction
            was used at any stage of image preparation, but a scan of a photographer's 18% grey
            card on the same scanner produced RGB values at the center of 91/95/107 after
            applying a 150% Gaussian Blur in Adobe Photoshop to average color values. Thus, a
            properly configured monitor should provide a reasonable approximation of colors on
            the manuscript pages.. </p>
         
         
         <p><strong>Transcription</strong>. Editing of the Doane journal emphasizes
            diplomatic transcription: abbreviations, recoverable cancelations, punctuation,
            spelling, underlining, additions above and below the line or in the margins,
            capitalization, line breaks, and page breaks have all been transcribed and encoded
            as
            they appear in the original manuscripts. The representation of those features varies
            depending on the view of the letter. An explanation of the presentation in each view
            of the letters can be read via the "About this View" link at the top of each view's
            page.</p>
         
         
         <p><strong>Markup and Annotation</strong>. XML encoding of the Doane journal
            follows The Text Encoding Initiative's (TEI) <cite>P5: Guidelines for
               Electronic Text Encoding and Interchange</cite>, as customized for the project
            using the TEI's ODD ("One Document Does it All") process. This editorial introduction
            and the three "views" of the letters were generated from the main XML file using XSL
            transformations to produce HTML Web pages. Several of the appendices were encoded
            in
            HTML separately. A more detailed description of the markup can be found via the
            "Appendices" menu, and all source files (XML, XSL, CSS, ODD, RNC) can be viewed and
            downloaded via the "Source Files" menu.</p>
         
         
         <p>Introductory material (such as this editorial introduction) as well as annotated
            lists of people and places mentioned in the letters are
            encoded in the TEI header of the main XML document. Other explanatory annotations
            are
            linked directly from the text. Separate appendices provide further information about
            the project (e.g., acknowledgements, editors' bios, and so on). All these ancillary
            materials can be viewed via the menus at the top of each page.</p>
         
         
         <p>
            <strong>Proofing</strong>. Students who created the original transcriptions
            proofread their own transcription and encoding. In preparation for peer review by
            NINES and preservation in The Ohio State University's Knowledge Bank, the
            transcriptions and encoding were once again proofread by Professor Ulman. </p>
         
         <p>
            <strong>Peer Review</strong>. Anonymous reviewers for NINES provided
            peer-reviews for the editions, in response to which they were revised and then
            reviewed by NINES editors before being listed in the NINES database. </p>
