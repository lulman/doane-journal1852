            as clearly evidenced in Louisa Doane’s journal. On March 7th, 1852, Louisa 
            describes an incident between Captain Doaneand his prisoners:</p> 
         <div class="blockquote"><br>"The Prisoners
            are singing at a great rate and disturbing us very much [.] When Father
            [ordered] them to stop which they did but gave him a very saucy reply, then
            Father [ordered?] the Second Mate not to give them but half a bread apiece
            for their suppers[.]" (lines 2133-2138)<br><br></div>
         <p> This quote demonstrates how the
            smallest indignation could result in the prisoners suffering often terrible
            consequences; in this example, an insolent remark deprived them of food.
            Those convicted of mutiny suffered even greater punishment. In a letter from
            Admiral Pringle to Evan Nepean, Esquire, on November 27th, 1797, T. Pringle
            describes in detail the repercussions of mutiny endured by those convicted.
            Pringle describes that mutiny threw ships into “a state of tumult,” often
            resulting in ship officers being sent ashore (Theal 207). When mutinous
            sailors were captured, they “were condemned by a Court Martial” and either
            sentenced to death or imprisonment (where chances of survival were slim due
            to unclean conditions) (Theal 208). When mutineers were sentenced to death,
            the execution took place only days later. Prisoners had no time to appeal
            their penalties. </p>
         
         <p>In Records of the Cape Colony from December
            1796, sailors on the Rattlesnake attempted to give an explanation for their
            mutinous thoughts by writing their grievances to His Majesty. Fifteen
            sailors describe that they suffered oppression under the hands of “young and
            inexperienced Officers” and that the Officers were men who “learned to
            Command before they had learned obedience” (Theal 174). Their list of
            complaints against their British officers is lengthy. First, they propose to
            the king that the officers “shall not harass nor oppress the subjects of
            Great Britain in any scandalous or Fraudulent manner,” causing readers to
            believe that treatment by British officers was, at the time, indecent (Theal 175). The sailors also wish to have “Two Washing Days in the Week instead of
            Two Hours” and wish “that sobriety be strictly observed” by the officers
            (Theal 175). Instead of being treated like equal servants of the British
            crown, sailors were heavily oppressed by officers and treated like slaves
            (similar to how Captain Doane treated his own ‘misbehaving’
            sailors).</p>
         
         <p>Towards the end of the 19th century, the US
            Navy abolished the flogging of sailors aboard sea vessels. This was a widely
            used tactic to control a ships crew along with any prisoners that may be
            aboard. It is likely that Captain Doane accepted this rule, as there is no
            evidence of Louisa Doane indicating her father did so. The withholding of parts of
            the prisoners meals is another sign that her father either disapproved of
            flogging or that he was abiding by the newly enacted law. One way the Navy
            was proposing to preserve the safety aboard ships was to begin utilizing
            Marine guards on sea-going vessels. “There can be no doubt as to the
            necessity of an increased and efficient Marine guard on board our ships,
            arising out of the abolition of flogging” (Senate 596). This quote, coming
            from a conversation between an Admiral and a Captain, acknowledges the need
            for further trained disciplinarians aboard vessels in the post-flogging era.
            During the time of Louisa Doane's voyage, martime laws
            were evolving and creating a more humane environment for sailors.

         <h3 id="julyfourth">19th Century Fourth of July Celebrations at Home and Abroad</h3>
         
         <p>In the mid-nineteenth century, Independence Day was a very important day to Americans.
            In the United States, 
            celebrations would last all day and include morning concerts, military reviews, children’s
            celebrations, 
            processions, balloon ascensions, and firework displays.  Whole towns would be extravagantly
            decorated with flags, 
            flowers, and banners.  But on a ship, those amenities would not be accessible.  Instead,
            crew members 
            would honor the birth of their nation by reciting speeches and odes, giving prayer,
            singing songs, 
            and reading the Declaration of Independence.  If food was available, lavish feasts
            would be prepared.  
            In some cases, sickness at sea inhibited excessive celebration and the healthy settled
            for talking patriotically over dinner.</p>
         
         <p>In regards to Fourth of July celebrations abroad, the extravagance and immensity of
            
            the celebrations varied depending on the time period and the country.  In a 
            <cite>New York Times</cite> news article published  displays many of the countries that had 
            celebrations that year for the Fourth of July including, Switzerland, England, France,
            
            and Germany.  In each of these countries the holiday was celebrated in very similar
            ways
            to how Louisa Doane describes her celebration; there were banquets with a large array 
            of food and drink and long lists of people who were in attendance and at the end of
            the
            night in France, “The utmost cordiality prevailed… and, amid great good feeling, the
            
            company separated at midnight with cheers for the French and American Republics”(New York Times) 
            It seems that the American Independence Day throughout the world was celebrated in
            much
            the same way as it was in the States.  In most cases it seems that when Fourth of
            July 
            celebrations occurred over seas during the 19th century it was mostly celebrated by
            Americans that happen to be away from home at the time.  But there are several instances
            where the celebrations were hosted by foreigners for their American friends.  In 
            another <cite>New York Times</cite> article published on  there was a toast made by an Englishman, who was hosting the festivities for his
            American guests, 
            to the health of the American President(New York Times).  So over all it is clear that Independence Day 
            was commonly recognized abroad and that Doane's description of her personal Fourth of July
            party was typical for Americans even though they were away from home. </p>
         
         
         
         <h3 id="epidemics">Epidemics At Sea</h3>
         
         <p>Sea travel mobilized many people from
            various regions, allowing diseases and epidemics to spread very quickly. One
            method of containing illnesses was to try to quarantine ships with sick
            sailors and travelers once they moved into the harbor, because the harbor
            was a primary place for epidemics to spread from person to person and from
            ship to ship. In the article "The Panama Fever" published in <em>Overland Monthly and Out West Magazine</em>, a traveler
            mentions taking the substance "Quinine" before leaving their ship and going
            ashore to Panama in the hopes that the medication might prevent them from
            getting Panama Fever (553). The
            illness was a strain of influenza that caused fever, nausea, vomiting, and
            dehydration. Some people were able to overcome the illness, and others did
            not (Thorington 150).</p>
         
         <p>Louisa
            Doane mentions Panama Fever during the time her ship was stationed in a harbor in South
            America. She mentions on her entry for  that six people from a neighboring ship had already died from
            the fever and that the ship was quarantined, not allowing any passengers
            from it to go on shore, and potentially spread the disease.</p>
         
         <p>In addition to Panama Fever, Cholera and
            Scurvy were very common on sea-faring vessels. In today's age Scurvy is only
            mentioned as an illness of the past. According to the <em>London Journal of Medicine</em>, Vol. 1, No. 2 (Feb. 1849), the author
            states, “It had become a matter of general belief, that Scurvy died with the
            last century: for, excepting in badly equipped vessels, the disease did not
            manifest itself” (181). Doctors have
            concluded that the treatment for Scurvy is nitrate. Scurvy was common among
            sailors because “holds, decks, and hatches, were so objectionable in a
            sanitary point of view… yet all suffered alike from Scurvy, simply because
            there was one peculiar condition common to all, namely, the want of
            vegetables” (189). In the days before
            refrigeration, only salted meats and grains could withstand perishing over
            time, and vegetables unfortunatly had a short shelf life, which made it hard
            to consume them over long sea voyages. If vessels ended up low on
            provisions, the conquered threat of Scurvy could become fearfully resurgent.
            </p>
         
         <p>Cholera was also another disease that
            infected many sailors and passengers. The  issue of <em>The North American Review</em>
            speaks about Cholera and says, “it began in maritime towns, as it had been
            said that Cholera does, and thence spread to the interior” (98). Since Cholera got its
            beginnings in maritime towns, it would be inevitable for a sailor to
            contract the disease. Later in that article, an eyewitness to an outbreak
            states, “the Cholera didn’t appear till seven days after she [the ship] had
            had intercourse with the shore” (105). This proves that Cholera has a gestation period, and
            the disease could easily overtake a vessel at sea in days. Cholera also
            thrives in filth, as ship surgeon Thomas Graham said in
            a journal, “There appears now to be no doubt but that a specific virus was
            brought on board by one of the soldiers, which has been called into action
            by the foul air from holds and crowded lower deck. The majority of the cases
            occurred among the soldiers who lived in the filthiest, most unventilated
            and overcrowded parts of the ship” (p12.v).</p>
         
         <p>All three of these diseases spread quickly,
            and espicially among many individuals living in the close, unsanitary
            conditions on ships. Ship harbors were the perfect places for these
            illnesses spread, and those infected on the ships carried the illness to the
            next destination on their journey. The threat of an epidemic on board would
            easily thwart Lousia Doane's voyage.
            Doane and the crew had to be cognizant of
            hygiene, cleanliness, and provisions to avoid health related disasters on
            board. Doane and the crew on her ship
            completed their voyage without any major ilnesses, but her journal's mention of such is a historically relevant
            account of epidemics on sea voyages as a fairly common and often devistating
            occurance.</p>
         
         
         
         
         <h3 id="merchantships">19th Century Merchant Vessels</h3>
         
         <p> Throughout her journal, Louisa Doane refers to a variety of sailing vessels
            that she encounters during her voyages abroad. Her references are not
            particularly informative - Doane generally
            only mentions the name and type of vessel, and even her most descriptive
            references are little more than remarks on the appearance of certain ships.
            This is perhaps understandable, as there seems to have been some debate as
            to what exactly constituted a ship in the 19th century. Author Arthur Thomas Quiller-Couch puts it best in <cite>The story of the sea, Volume 1</cite>, saying that, "A ship,
            according to Act of Parliament, is 'any fabric that is not propelled by
            oars.' This is how the law defines it, but any sailor will tell you that in
            this matter, as Mr. Bumble once remarked, 'the law is a hass'" (20). However brief, Doane's notations are nevertheless an indication of the
            importance of ships and the solidarity between sailing vessels in
            19th-century sea trade. The casual, cursory remarks made in the journal
            suggest that Doane was at least vaguely
            familiar with the types of ships she mentions, and she indeed boarded many
            of these vessels and visited with the captains and their
            families.</p>
         
         <p><strong>Clipper Ships</strong>. The
            term "clipper ship" was applied to a ship to indicate that it sailed very
            fast. They often carried very valuable items. ("A
            history of the city of San Francisco) Extreme clippers
            sacrificed cargo capacity for speed. California clippers could transport
            large quantities of goods quickly. The range of clipper ship models were so
            diverse, that it is impossible to make generalizations about their
            appearance. The American clipper ship era really only extended from 1845 to
            1859.("Clipper
            Ships")</p>
         
         <p><strong>Schooners</strong>. One very prevalent vessel during the 19th
            century was the schooner. According to the Oxford English dictionary online,
            a schooner is “A small sea-going fore-and-aft rigged vessel, originally with
            only two masts, but now often with three or four masts and carrying one or
            more topsails.” They were often used because they needed a comparatively
            smaller crew than other similar sized ships. Schooners were used for many
            things in the 19th century, but its original purpose was to transport cargo.
            Often, however, it was used for more devious purposes. There are accounts of
            Schooners being used to transport slaves("The Doom
            of the Slaver") and also being used as pirate vessels(in
            1822 the schooner Aspray was chased down by two
            pirate vessels, both were schooners.)("Journal of
            Voyages"). Also, the Schooner Dolphin was used by the United States Navy in 1825 to track down
            mutineers from the whale ship Globe. The mutineers
            had taken the whaling ship to the Mulgrave islands, but when they went on
            shore loyal sailors took control of the ship and brought it back to the
            United States. At that time the commodore of the naval squadron in the
            Pacific was ordered to dispatch the schooner Dolphin to track down the
            mutineers and capture them so an example could be made of them("Journal of a Cruise of the United States Schooner
            Dolphin"). Also, according to Hunt's Yachting Magazine, “A
            large cutter of from 70 to 100 tons will be found a very far more expensive
            vessel to handle than a schooner of equal tonnage”(ROY). It was cheeper to
            use a schooner because, due to the way it was rigged, it took less people to
            handle it. From these examples, you can see that schooners were used for a
            variety of things in the 19th century, even though they were most commonly
            used as merchant vessels. </p>
         
         <p><strong>Barque</strong>.  One type of ship mentioned specifically by
            Doane is the bark (alternatively spelled
            barque). In Man on the Ocean, an account of numerous ocean-going vessels and
            sailing history, Scottish author R. M.
            Ballantyne goes into great detail when describing the bark and
            what differentiates it from other similar ships. He writes, "The vessel next
            in size larger than the brig, is the barque. It does not follow, however,
            that its being larger constitutes it a barque. Some brigs are larger than
            barques, but generally the barque is the larger vessel. The difference
            between a barque and a brig is that the former has three masts, the two
            front ones being square-rigged, and the mizzen being fore-and-aft rigged"
            (214). Despite having very
            distinct sail-plans and rigging, barques were annoyingly similar to brigs
            and barquentines, and the varying appearance of the barque makes it even
            more difficult to differentiate it from other ships. For instance, adding a
            fore-and-aft-rigged mizzen-mast to the after part of a brig would convert it
            into a barque, just as a sharply-built and trim-rigged clipper barque is
            simply a fast-sailing barque (214).
            Although she never goes into such technical detail, Doane's references to ships of various types suggests two
            things - that she either had enough knowledge of seafaring ships to
            differentiate the vessels, or that she had enough interest in ships to learn
            such information from someone else and document it in her journal.
            </p>
         
         
         
         <h3 id="burialatsea">Honoring the Dead at Sea</h3>
         
         
         <p>Burial at sea was not the ideal way for someone to be buried in the 1800s, but a 
            necessity when someone died while on a ship at sea.  When a person was buried at 
            sea, there was no way to mark the spot where the body was buried, which meant 
            family and friends could not visit in the future to mourn.  An editorial article in
            the 
            <cite>Maryland Gazette</cite> from 1829 describes how members of a ship’s crew wrapped the
            dead body in a hammock and put the body in a coffin before tossing it overboard (A Burial at Sea).  The crew wanted to respect the life lost by covering the body, 
            though the body would sink to the bottom of the sea once thrown overboard.  Doane 
            mentions in her journal that the bodies of the dead were also wrapped in cloth before
            the burial, but since Doane was in the harbor, the crew was able to bury the body.  
            Even though the body was buried, the crew sent out a small boat to sea in memory of
            
            the life lost.  A crew would most likely not come prepared to handle a death while
            at 
            sea, but both crews did their best to respect the body and keep it covered for burial.</p>
         
         
         <p>Beyond the practical reasons for burial at sea, there was often much superstition
            
            surrounding the ceremony. On land, many burial rituals developed around the fear that
            
            the dead would return to haunt the living. Sailors struggled with this same concern,
            and 
            many of their burial practices parroted land practices. The corpse on land is removed
            
            from a house feet first, so that the spirit would be unable to find its way back to
            its former 
            home. Sailors adapted this practice to the sea by placing weights at the feet of the
            
            hammock so the feet would sink first, and the front of the body was usually oriented
            
            away from the ship when it was dumped into the sea (Stewart 280). Many other 
            superstitions surrounded the burial process and the separation of dead from the living
            at 
            sea, but Doane curiously does not seem to share these concerns. While she describes the
            sewing up of the bodies and once mentions that the deceased’s friends went to see
            the 
            burial, she never mentions any ceremony surrounding the disposal of the dead, and
            she 
            does not seem to share the common sailor’s fear of the soul returning if it is not
            properly laid to rest.</p>
         
         
         <p>In her journal, Doane writes of deaths and funerals aboard the ship in a very professional 
            manner. Because she is in some ways an apprentice to her father, Doane’s journal is more a captain’s 
            log than an emotional account of events that occurred on ship. While many travel accounts
            from the time
            describe the feelings evoked by the ceremony use words like "solemn" and "impressive"
            to describe it, Doane refrains from describing the emotional
            aspects of the burial (Irving 237 )(Coultor 223). Instead, she provides a factual description of the practices, such as wrapping the
            bodies in cloth 
            and sending them out in a boat. Death and funerals are a difficult part of life for
            many people, but 
            visiting a burial site often helps with the feeling of loss of a loved one. However,
            Doane shows 
            others(burials throughout the journal took place on other ships) who lost loved ones
            at sea who did 
            not have the luxury of visiting a burial site. But Doane seems to handle her emotions very well, saying only 
            that the sight of one dead man made her “feel sad” (Doane 47b). By reading what Doane says about 
            death and burials at sea, we can see that she is a very strong girl who is much wiser
            than her young years.</p>
         
         
         
         
         <p><strong>Discipline and Prisoner Treatment Aboard Ship</strong></p>
         
         <p>Discipline was an important part of life aboard ship. From the captain's stand point,
            it was needed for order and allowed jobs on ship
            to be performed safely and effectively (Pollock 24). Discipline was seen as 
            needed for the protection of the sailors. The captain of the ship was the enforcer
            of all punishment. Discipline on board ship was based on the captain (Hodgskin 35).
            If the captain of the ship changed or if a crew member joined a new ship the rules
            and regulations changed. Discipline was considered a direct reflection on the captain
            (Hodgskin 35). If a ship had a long list of crew members getting punished, it looked bad on the
            captain. Captain Doane would have
            continuingly been dealing with the discipline of his crew and prisoners. Some of the
            problems he would have faced with his crew and prisoners would have com from
            problems like drunkness, rioting, theft, and unlawful violence (Pollock 24). According to several of Lousia Doane'sentries,
            the crew and prisoners on her father's ship were constanttly trying to steal food. On , the prisoners were caught stealing
            bread. On , a sailor asked Captain Doane for more molasses. Captain Doane
            says the sailor had already received his ration of molasses and will be given no more. The sailor threatens to steal the molasses. Poor conditions on many ships were 
            thought to escalate problems on board. However, a good captain only used punishment
            if it was absolutely necessary.
            </p>
         
         <p>In the event that a sailor commited an offense that warranted imprisonment, it was
            again up to the captain to mete out punishment beyond that. For more serious crimes,
            they were sometimes removed from the
            ship completely. In her entry from , Louisa Doane describes an incident in which the prisoners are freed after rats chew
            through their iron shackles, and are roaming freely inside the ship. She writes that her father summoned an armed force to deal with the 
            disobedience, and goes to shore to determine their ultimate fate. A few sentences
            later she says that "at noon a Policeman came off and took them all on Shore and [put] them
            in Prison".
            For lesser offenses, the punishments were more mundane on the <i>Commonwealth</i>. In an entry on , the prisoners are singing and being "saucy",
            and are rebuked by having their suppers cut down to half a piece of bread. On , she recalls an occurrence when a fighting sailor
            is whipped and put in irons. In the first half of the 19th century, there was a call
            to replace the more severe forms of corporal punishment with more humane treatment,
            as described by
            Myra C. Glenn in the article "The Naval Reform Campaign Against Flogging: A Case Study in Changing Attitudes Toward
            Corporal Punishment, 1830-1850".
            Glenn writes that the reformers "sought to discipline the mind, not to punish the body",
            and in  naval flogging was outlawed
            (409). However, on a merchant ship such as the <i>Commonwealth</i>, not bound by the laws of the military, the ship's captain was essentially free to
            do
            as he wished to the sailors, including flogging, which at times Glenn says had the unintended effect of promoting "disorder and insubordination...[and
            that]repeated floggings
            "hardened" sailors against officers and engendered "baneful feelings of insubordination"
            (414). In some ways this harsh treatment of prisoners explains the continuous
            disciplinary problems that Captain Doane has with his sailors, as he is quite a harsh leader and disciplinarian.

            Guano was of surplus in Peru for a very long time, mostly because of their fish market.
            
            Certain fish like anchovies and others were attracted to the 
            (Humboldt Current in the Eastern Pacific ocean) which in turn attracted birds 
            like white-breast cormorants, gray pelicans, and piqueros to the area for the fish.
            
            The Humboldt Current brings in nutrient filled water to the shores vital for the guano
            and sustains 
            the (marine ecosystem for marine life and birds.) 
            The bird droppings then would retain the nitrate in it and then producing Guano. 
            
            The industry was at its peak from around 1840-1880, when they sold upwards of 
            20 million tons mostly to Great Britain, 
            (earning the country of Peru around 2 billion dollars in profits.) 
            </p>
         
         <p>
            Guano was used for fertilizer and fire powder during this time and was in great demand.
            
            Peru then lost the rights of 
            the guano to Chile and then the rest to France 
            when the countries were preparing for war. 
            The situation of the industry turned sour after World War I when the 
            Germans invented something in place of guano which was 
            the Haber process, making guano have no value.  
            The fish population declined which in turn meant less and less birds 
            that would come there, which meant less bird droppings for the guano to produce. 
            
            (There is also the Guano Islands Act of 1856 where the islands that produce 
            the guano are protected and allows U.S. civilians to take possession of these islands.)

         <h3 id="medical">Health and Medicine in the 19th-Century Merchant Marine</h3>
         
         <p>One of the topics Louisa Doane discusses in detail in her journal is that of health.  
            Her concern in reporting on this topic reflects a broader interest in the health and
            
            medical treatment of sailors and sea-travelers evidenced in publications of the time.
            
            The  issue of <cite>The Friend: A Religious and Literary Journal</cite> reprints 
            a review of the new edition of <cite>Physician for Ships</cite> which originally appeared in the 
            <cite>Boston Medical and Surgical Review</cite>.  The reviewer remarks favorably on the volume, 
            saying, "Sailors suffer exceedingly for the want of medical advice.  All vessels,
            
            or nearly all, have a medicine chest, but no medical directions worthy of credence...Our
            
            merchants ought to put a copy on board of every vessel leaving port" (107).  
            Doane makes no mention of such a book on board the ships she sails on, but Doane does 
            mention her father administering medicine on several occasions.  The picture Louisa 
            Doane draws of seafaring medicine, therefore, shows her father as the chief medical 
            man on board, diagnosing and dispensing according to his judgment, and often with the 
            help of Doane and her mother.  Significantly, the quality of care that the men receive 
            under Captain Doane’s command stands in contrast to that received by Doane and her father 
            on shore from a licensed physician.  With some historical context, one may read Doane’s 
            journal as evidence of how the differential care of sailors and individuals at sea
            versus 
            on land highlighted class differences, and particularly demonstrates the common disregard
            
            for the health of merchant mariners in the 19th century.</p>
         
         
         <p><strong>Disparate Care: The Navy and the Merchant Marine</strong> Captain Doane's service 
            as primary medical practitioner aboard 
            the <i>Commonwealth</i> points to the varied accessibility to and quality 
            of medical care available to sailors in the 19th century.  Nineteenth 
            century medical treatment and practice for sailors was differentiated 
            by employer affiliation: naval sailors received higher quality and more 
            consistent health care than merchant marine sailors.  This was due in 
            large part to the fact that naval sailors were responsible for protecting 
            the nation, whereas merchant mariners were often employed on a case-by-case 
            basis, one voyage at a time.  Contemporary physician Gilbert Blane explains: 
            "Money would avail nothing to the public defence without a sufficient number 
            of able and healthy men, which are the real resources of a state, and the true 
            sinews of war" (Lloyd 151).  In contrast to views of naval sailors as the 
            "true sinews of war," mercantile mariners were seen as replaceable and therefore 
            commercial ship owners experienced less economic and moral pressure to maintain 
            quality healthcare on board their ships.  In his examination of 19th century 
            British merchant ships, G.C. Cook highlights the perceived expendability of 
            these sailors: "merchant seamen…lived a most erratic existence—often being 
            employed (frequently by ship owners who were often unscrupulous) for a 
            single voyage only" (225).</p>
         
         
         <p><strong>Medical Care on the <i>Commonwealth</i></strong>
            This attitude of expendability that informed the treatment of mercantile sailors’
            health is
            documented in Doane’s journal as well and represents a significant 
            characterization of the relationship between Captain Doane and the sailors 
            in his charge.  The importance of their health and the seriousness of their 
            illness is downplayed significantly in two instances, on  and , 
            1852, respectively, wherein Doane reports 
            that Captain Doane believes sailors are "making believe" that they are ill 
            or "fained [sic] sick."  However, even when actual illness is acknowledged 
            and treated by Captain Doane, concern for the sailor’s wellbeing is seen 
            second to his ability to perform the duties for which he has been hired.</p>
         
         
         <p>A series of episodes on board the <i>Commonwealth</i> illustrates both 
            the uncertainty of diagnosis and the unequal administration of medical 
            aid.  Early on in the voyage to Peru, Doane mentions her father 
            administering treatment to a cat having a fit.  In her  
            entry Doane writes that after the administration of ether, the cat was 
            "playing around as common."  On the other hand, when a sailor has a fit 
            Doane writes about it in her  entry without mentioning 
            any treatment given to him, merely saying "[he] soon came out of it" but 
            noting that the next day "his eyes are very wild."</p>  
         
         
         <p>
            While Doane's concern for the health of her kittens 
            during this voyage might help explain her more vague 
            references to the treatment of the sailor, it could 
            also be seen as reflecting the ways in which merchant 
            sailors were not shown much concern, especially since 
            fits were considered very serious in the 19th century.  
            James Ewell, in <cite>The Planter's and Mariner's Medical 
               Companion</cite>, notes that there are four kinds of fits: 
            apoplectic, epileptic, fainting, and hysteric.  
            Fainting and hysteric fits were largely the province 
            of women, and Ewell discusses apoplectic and epileptic 
            fits as being very dangerous, saying of apoplectic fits, 
            "In the cure of a disease, threatening such sudden fatality, 
            remedies must be speedily employed" (114).
            </p>
         
         
         <p>Although Louisa Doane does not seem to consider 
            the sailor's health as in grave danger at the 
            time of his fit, she does note in her  
            entry that he still seems very sick and has 
            applied to her parents for medical advice since 
            he is convinced that he "was going to Die as he 
            had the chills upon him."  The Doanes' response 
            is to take the sailor's pulse and then reassure 
            him that it is strong and he has little to worry 
            about.  Harold Langley, in a study of the early 
            U.S. Navy, notes that the pulse was considered 
            an indicator of health and that "If the pulse 
            was slow or weak, the doctor concluded that 
            the vascular fibers were weak or lax.  If the 
            pulse was fast, the physician deduced that the 
            vascular fibers were hyperactive and that fever 
            was present, for hyperactivity produced heat" (31).  
            A strong pulse, therefore, would be indicative of
            health.  The medicine which Doane says her parents 
            dispense to the sailor is not named, but it is likely 
            that it was a purgative—either a laxative or an emetic—since 
            purging was considered to be the first course of 
            treatment when fevers were feared (Ewell 25), and, as 
            Langley notes, cathartics (laxatives) and emetics were 
            among three of the most commonly-prescribed treatments 
            for ailments in the 19th century (31).</p>
         
         
         <p>
            Following the documentation of the sailor’s fear of 
            Panama Fever and the administration of the medicine, 
            Doane notes in the next day's entry that the sailor's 
            health is greatly improved and that he has returned to 
            his work, which illustrates that the main purpose of 
            administering medical care to any sailor on board would 
            be to make him fit for duty as quickly as possible.  
            Providing medicine to sailors on board merchant vessels, as we can 
            see from this episode, depends largely on the needs 
            and judgment of the captain of the ship, who is invested 
            more in maintaining their required work regimen by dosing 
            sick sailors with medicines perceived to be generally effective 
            than in diagnosing and treating them with care and precision.
            </p>
         
         
         <p><strong>Medical Care in Port</strong>. Despite the differential quality of medical treatment for 
            naval and merchant seamen <em>at sea</em>, medical treatment on land 
            and in port was more consistent and higher quality for both 
            ships’ passengers and sailors.  James Cassedy explains that 
            while individual treatment for sailors varied from ship to 
            ship, "at home...there was considerable feeling that the federal 
            government had a responsibility to provide for seamen who were 
            permanently disabled by shipboard accidents or who returned to 
            the United States with serious or persistent ailments" (15-16).  
            Consuls were installed in foreign ports with whom trade agreements 
            had been signed to ensure that sick American sailors received 
            medical attention abroad (Langley 3).  As a result, the care 
            that individuals received on land was significantly superior 
            in quality to that which they received at sea.
            </p>
         
         
         <p>
            The difference in care received by individuals at sea versus 
            those on shore is highlighted in Doane’s journal by the fact 
            that both she and Captain Doane are treated by a medical physican.  
            Captain Doane is treated for gout with a bread and milk poultice 
            and an herbal bath in Marseilles on the ; Doane 
            receives an herbal tea for a fever on the .  Both of these 
            conditions are monitored closely and Doane reports that, had 
            Captain Doane’s condition worsened, the doctor would have 
            "administered leeches." It is clear from these excerpts that 
            the well-being of Doane and her father are closely attended to 
            and progress is observed carefully.  Significantly, while Captain 
            Doane is the primary medical practitioner at sea, in port he seeks 
            the services of a trained doctor rather than treating himself.  
            Doane’s and Captain Doane’s confidence in the physician’s 
            abilities is evidenced by Doane’s report of their improved 
            conditions upon receiving treatment. 
            </p>
         
         
         <p><strong>Conclusions: Medicine and Class on the <i>Commonwealth</i></strong> A cursory 
            comparison of the Doanes' own medical 
            treatment on land versus Captain Doane's ministrations 
            and responses to sailors' on-ship illnesses supports 
            historical claims about the treatment of mercantile 
            sailors in the 19th century.  James Baldwin, a contemporary 
            surgeon who sympathizes with the sailors’ position writes: 
            "If the lives of our seamen are considered of any importance, 
            either in a moral or commercial point of view, some regard 
            ought surely to be extended toward the preservation of their 
            lives, in those climates where diseases are rapid in their 
            progress, and too generally fatal in their termination, 
            without the prompt aid of the Physician" (qtd. in Cassedy 15).  
            Doane's presentation of sickness on the <i>Commonwealth</i> demonstrates 
            the complexity of her position—as a young woman she empathizes 
            with their suffering, but is also distanced from it by her 
            position as the captain's daughter. 
            </p>
         
         
         <h3 id="food">Food and Diet Aboard 19th Century Merchant Marine Ships</h3>
         
         <p>
            Doane frequently records what she eats and
            cooks at sea, and she includes stories about various livestock kept on
            board. These notations in her journal signal to us as contemporary readers
            that food and diet are central concerns for crew and passengers. In fact,
            Doane's account suggests that food and
            diet are connected to all kinds of other social interactions on board,
            including social hierarchies, ship discipline, hospitality between ships, and
            general health concerns. This preoccupation with food makes sense given that
            while out to sea those on board only had access to food stocked on
            the ship or food given to them by other ships they met at sea.  With limited
            resources, the risk of spoiling or damage to food, and both sailors and
            passengers to feed, food becomes bound up with the social lives of those on
            board in several interesting ways. </p>
         
         <p> The kinds of foods Doane eats on board seem consistent with other accounts of
            the foods ships generally took with them to sea. In his account of life on
            merchant ships, Frank Thomas Bullen writes
            that American ships often had the best food stocks compared to other
            countries (214). According to his
            experiences sailing in the mid to late 1800s, American ships generally kept
            potatoes, onions, flour, dried apples, and cranberries in addition to the
            usual staples of salt beef and pork, bread, rice, and pea soup (214). This variety is important because
            ships that carried fewer vegetables often struggled with bouts of illness,
            particularly scurvy. Doane mentions eating
            plenty of salted meats, but she also records eating pancakes and potatoes,
            making fruit jelly, trading fruit cake with one ship, and receiving oranges,
            onions, and pumpkins from another ship. She notes that they carry pigs and
            chickens on board to kill and eat in addition to the stocked cured meat.
            This variety of food is probably related to her social position on board,
            but it demonstrates the kinds of foods ships comfortably could sail with.
            Her mother's birthday celebration provides a
            case in point: for the dinner they feast on boiled beef, pork, potatoes,
            prunes, wine, lemonade, plum pudding, and pumpkin pie. Even the sailors
            receive wine and cake for this special celebration. </p>
         
         <p>
            Doane's journal also shows the ways in which
            food could function as both a privilege or a means of disciplining the
            sailors. In her book <cite>Food in the United States</cite>,
            historian Susan Williams has chronicled the
            ways in which food increasingly became associated with social status during
            the 19th century. She writes, "For a rapidly growing American middle class,
            the meal structure, food served, presentation, and dining rituals all
            reinforced new standards of gentility" (153). On board, we can see this relationship between social
            status and dining in several ways. At one point, the Doane family allows the
            carpenter, who is not usually invited to eat with them because he is a
            "foreigner" of unknown origins, to eat with them in the cabin. Doane later finds out that the carpenter felt
            embarrassed not only to be eating with them, but also to be eating while her
            mother sat at the table.</p> 
         
         <p> On other occassions, Doane witnesses sailors being denied food for 'misbehaving'.
            For example, on March 3rd, one sailor asks the captain if he thinks that the
            ration of potatoes given to the crew is enough for six men. The captain
            responds by taking away all their potatoes as punishment for complaining
            about their fare. Sources from around the time period suggest that depriving
            sailors of food was not necessarily considered an appropriate means of
            punishing them. In his 1879 edition of <cite>The seaman's
               friend</cite>, R. H. Dana Jr. asserts
            that all crew members have a right to food, and under no occassion should
            the ship's master deny sailors this right (209). In fact, Dana
            suggests that sailors could technically win money in court if they proved
            they had been denied food. That we see sailors denied basic food like
            potatoes suggests that while at sea such rules were not always followed. But
            Doane, as a captain's daughter, appears
            to have eaten very well and had access to a variety of food and cooking
            supplies.</p>

            A. Doane's Journal</h3>
         
         
         <p><strong>Women on Board</strong>. Though
            Doane's position as a captain's daughter
            aboard the <i>Commonwealth</i> might seem not to fit with
            contemporary readers' perceptions of nineteenth-century women's roles and
            spaces, Doane and her
            mother's decision to join Edmund
            Doane was certainly not anomalous. Despite modern stereotypes to
            the contrary, life aboard nineteenth century ships was not entirely
            homosocial. Captains' wives, as well as wives of ship's labourers like naval
            "boatswains, carpenters, and cooks," and even prostitutes would go to sea,
            and were provided with abilities to actively contribute to seafaring life
            (Cordingly, xi-xii). Recent
            archival work published by Haskell Springer
            in <cite>Iron men, wooden women: gender and seafaring in the
               Atlantic world, 1700-1920</cite> involved gathering information from
            "the journals of thirty-six women who went to sea between 1826 and 1913"
            (92). Drawing on work like
            Springer's, or Joan
            Druett's extensive surveys of nineteeth century women at sea
            allows readers of Doane's sea journal to
            more ably contextualize her experiences, and integrate them into a wider
            narrative of the seafaring woman.</p>
         
         <p>
            Doane's journal fits many of the conventions
            Springer and Druett's work describe. Though most primary source documents
            are the writings of captain's wives, not captain's daughters, though it has
            been estimated that "hundreds of children were raised on board ship"
            (<cite>Hen Frigates</cite>
            90), they still provide helpful context for a young
            woman's life at sea. Personal diaries are often gendered as female, and in
            the Victorian period, the diary genre enjoyed the distinction of being the
            "preeminent form of written expression among women" (Springer, 94). Yet, the female-written
            sea journal is also somewhat of a hybrid form, as these diarists would often
            include elements specific to a ship's log, a type of writing "normally the
            province of men," specifically male sea captains (Ibid. 93). Though we are not yet sure
            to what specific purpose (if any) Louisa
            Doane kept her journal, from noting that she included latitude
            and longitude coordinates, carefully cited occasions for the raising and
            lowering of sails, and carefully noted wind and weather conditions in her
            entries, we are able to conjecture that she was simultaneously in the
            practice of learning the craft of captaining a merchant vessel. </p>
         
         <p>This sort of shipboard education was not
            entirely uncommon, as the stories of Mary
            Patten and Emma Armstrong
            reveal. In
            1856, nineteen year-old Mary Patten left New
            York with her husband to sail to San Francisco. On a previous voyage, she
            was "taught about the winds and tides," and her husband "showed her how to
            calculate the ship's position with the aid of the sextant and the
            chronometer, how to work out the correct course to steer, and how to keep a
            daily record of the ship's progress in the logbook" (Cordingly, 112). When he collapsed
            while rounding Cape Horn (on October 25,
            Doane herself notes that "she has heard a
            great deal about its being a
            Dreadfull
            Dreadful
             place"), Patten, pregnant and with
            a crew on the verge of mutiny, was able to direct the <i>Neptune's Car</i> to San Francisco
            Bay. On the same route twenty-three years later, Armstrong "was taught to navigate...finding their position
            every noon" under her father's guidance, a skill which helped the fifteen
            year-old bring the Templar, and it's $200,000 cargo, safely into port
            (Druett, 89-90). </p>
         
         <p> Still, despite her abnormal (at least for
            land-bound girls) education in seafaring, Doane seems to still prescribe to typical gender roles.
            Springer suggests that, at times, "even as
            they broke with maritime tradition and went to sea, [captain's wives] found
            their lives more closely approximating the prescribed strictures of separate
            male and female spheres than did the women remaining ashore” (95). After healing from what seems to
            be a rather severe case of sea sickness, Almira
            Doane spends much time reading. She also helps her daughter cut out material for a new dress,
            oversees the making of pancakes, "current jelly", mince pies, sausages and
            donuts, and tends to washing socks and handkerchiefs: all typically
            "womanly" activites for a comfortable nineteenth-century
            homemaker.</p>
         
         <p> Though often stimulating, life aboard a
            merchant ship was not always pleasant, especially for young, upper-middle
            class women like Doane. She and her mother were still
            very much outnumbered by men aboard the <i>Commonwealth</i>, and feelings of isolation were not uncommon.
            Doane writes on March 30 of her
            excitement at seeing "two ladies on board" a passing ship, "which was quite
            a party 
            to to
            to 
            us, as we have been out forty three days, and  have seen nothing
            but sky and water, and a  great deal of ruff rough 
            weather." Springer identifies this
            "longing for other women" as a primary trope in the captain's wives journals
            that comprise his study. Imagine the relief even further into her voyage, when the Doane women were "very much  pleased to see a Lady after
            being out 84  days and seeing nothing but men." </p>
         
         <p>
            <strong>Heirarchies in the Merchant Marines</strong>.The class and
            gender hierarchies that would have structured Doane's life in the mid-nineteenth century are further
            complicated by the already complex power structures of a merchant ship like
            the <i>Commonwealth</i>. As Springer notes, a woman in Doane's position would not have much contact with most of the
            crew, but would generally be on formal speaking terms with only the "mates,
            steward, cook, and cabin boy" (95). This seems to be the case in the encoded
            sections of the journal, but even these class divisions did not exempt Doane
            from being exposed to power struggles aboard the ship. According to
            Falconer's, one late-eighteenth century seafarer's dictionary, the role of a
            captain was to</p> 
         <div class="blockquote"><br>Shew a laudable example of honour and virtue
            to the officers and men, and to discountenance all dissolute, immoral,
            and disorderly practices, and such as are contrary to the rules of
            discipline and subordination, as well as to correct those who are guilty
            of such offences, as are punishable according to the usage of the sea
            ("Captain," Falconer's Dictionary of
            the Sea)<br><br></div> 
         <p> Louisa's
            father is called upon to enforce discipline regularly. As just
            a few examples, February 6 sees drunken sailors sent below decks, while on
            March 9, Captain Doane is called to part a
            fight between the First Mate and a sailor. On October 15, the Second Mate insults his
            Captain with much "loud talk" after refusing to scrape
            barnacles from the ship's hull; his punishment is to stand watch until he is
            willing to obey orders, a punishment which is doled out to another sailor on
            March 9 and 10. Doane is even directly
            involved in a confrontation with the cabin boy on October 14, when he is
            "very cross and would answer us [Doane,
            her mother, and the cook] up quite
            sharp." On January 3, 1853, the Second
            Mate flogs a sailor, despite the outcry against this practice
            in the decade from 1840-1850, when it was finally outlawed (Glenn, 408-409); regardless, the sailor
            continues with his transgressions, and goes on "talking very saucy to
            [Captain Doane]" and was "then secured in
            Irons"</p>
         
         <p>Generally, though contemporary discourses
            painted sailors as full of vice, "abandoned miscreants, ripe for any
            mischief of villainy," Doane and her mother's dealings with the Steward and Mates
            seem civil and productive (Wilson,
            xi-xii). They often work together cleaning the ship and
            performing tasks for the general upkeep of the vessel, like preparing food,
            general nursing, and preparing for storms. Doane even reacts to some of the sailor's grievances with
            pity. When her father upbraids a sailor for asking for more potatoes with
            his beef on March 3, 1852, Doane "is most sorry for them." She learns to respect
            the practical hardships of seafaring for these working men during a harsh
            storm on November 10,</p>

         <p><strong>Marseille.</strong> Unlike the thousands of Americans who made the
            trip across the Atlantic in the nineteenth century, bent on exploring fashionable
            European destinations ((Scriber 13), (
            Stowe 3-15 )), Louisa Doane
             was one of a number of women who were, as Mary Suzanne Schriber 
            puts it, 
            ""accidental tourists""
            
            ((13)). Doane
             travelled in the capacity 
            of daughter, accompanying her merchant father as 
            he travelled to France for business.
            After a trying 54 days at sea, Doane and her 
            family spent just 23 days on the 
            continent, throughout which they remained in the busy sea-port city of Marseille. It is uncertain, therefore, whether 
            Doane 
            would have looked forward to her time in Marseille 
            in the same way that other American travelers eagerly anticipated 
            their grand European tours. 
            Her desire to reach Marseille, exhibited in her entry dated 
            29th March, seems not to stem from the excitement of seeing new places, but 
            rather from an understandable longing to finally get off the ship: 
            ""if this wind 
            continues we shall get there tomorrow morning [. . .] Oh dear I hope we shall, 
            for this is fifty two days at sea which is a long passage, and I am quite tired."
            "
            </p>
         
         <p>Not surprisingly then, Doane's 
            first entries upon arriving in Marseille focus on food and lodging. She carefully describes 
            their boarding house, and provides long lists of what was served to them at mealtimes:</p> 
         
         <div class="blockquote"><br>I will now tell you what we had for dinner, beef soup 
            rost roastturkey, rost roast beef, boiled lamb, stewed 
            chickens, potatoes, and spinagespinach, for desert dessertpie, 
            oranges, apples, pears, figs, for tea we had preserved beef, boiled ham, fresh 
            pork, white bread, butter, olives, stewed 
            pears, frosted cake, and then the fruit as 
            we had at dinner (1 April 1852).<br><br></div>
         <p>
            The extent to which she documents these details suggest the sense of 
            joy that must have accompanied her arrival on dry land, where food was varied and
            
            plentiful, and her accomodation was, as she notes, made of 
            ""stone" (1 April 1852)"
            !</p>
         
         <p>During their time in Marseille, 
            Doane
            and her parents chose to stay at an American hotel. Writing for the <cite>
               The Western Monthly </cite>in 1869, Joseph Kirkland was quick to criticize such
            institutions, arguing that, 
            ""to go to an American hotel abroad, and otherwise
            to herd with one's own fellow countrymen, is a confession of homesickness and of
            regret for having left home at all. The place to see Americans is America. In
            foreign lands the true sight to be seen is 
            "'These Foreigners'"
            " "
            (248).
            Doane, however, did not share his 
            contempt. She notes that the landlady, though
            French, had happily, 
            ""been in New York a number of years and could speak very 
            good english" "
            and is delighted
            to find that friends of their's, a Captain Eliott 
            and his family, are also staying at the hotel (1 April
            1852). Again, Doane's 
            warm enthusiasm seems to suggest some relief at once 
            more finding herself amongst familiar company, and perhaps recalls an earlier occasion
            at sea when she wistfully observes women on-board a passing ship: 
            ""we saw there
            were two ladies on board, which was quite a party to to us, 
            as we have been out forty three days, and have seen nothing but 
            sky and water, and a great deal of ruff rough
            weather" "
            (21 March 1852).</p>
         
         <p>Whether or not Doane 
            did think of herself as a young holiday-maker in France,
            her time in Marseille seems to be have been
            as much practically spent as it was leisurely. She records details of a number of
            visits to the dentist, and refers to a shopping trip, both of which, after so long
            at sea,
            must have been all too necessary. The imminence of their departure must surely have
            
            been ever-present in Doane's 
            mind, and might be imagined to have had some influence
            over the way in which she spent her days in Marseille
            . Certainly, in addition to her more practical excursions, 
            Doane seems 
            to have been keen to make the most of her time abroad, and her journal entries 
            describe trips around Marseille and the 
            local culture. Although she rarely refers to sites that she visited by name, the 
            details she gives suggest that she visited both the Abbaye Saint-Victor and the
            Porte D'Aix, in addition to making frequent trips around the city on foot and 
            horseback.</p>
         
         <p>Had she consulted the various contemporary guidebooks available to American 
            tourists however, and whether or not she did is, of course, difficult to know, 
            she may have been disappointed. <cite>A Satchel Guide for the Vacation
               Tourist</cite>, published in 1924, dedicates barely more than half a page to 
            Marseille, while John Murray's 
            <cite>A Handbook for Travellers in France </cite>(1867) and 
            <cite>Norton's Hand-Book to Europe; or, How to Travel in the Old World 
               </cite>(1860) have little in the way of praise to offer France's biggest sea-port.
            Indeed, writing in the <cite>Norton's Hand-Book</cite>, J. H. Siddons
            warns his readers that Marseille 
            ""has
            all the disagreeable features of an ordinary sea-port town, and some very offensive
            ones which are peculiarly its own," "
            and advises that they 
            ""regulate [their]
            arrival at Marseille that the place may
            be immediately quitted for Malta and Alexandria" (
            (167)). "
            That is about the full extent of his observations about
            Doane's destination. Murray goes into more 
            detail, but is hardly any more positive.
            The port he describes as the 
            ""sewer of the city""
            , the old town as 
            "
            "scarcely worth entering" ((476))"
            , 
            and his account of the artwork displayed in various council buildings is no less
            scathing: 
            ""The subjects are all horrible""
            , he notes, 
            ""and the execution 
            not good enough to compensate" ((467))"
            .
            </p>
         
         <p>If Doane found any of this to be true, she 
            gives no indication of it in her
            journal, and the delight with which she records the details of her dinners and 
            suppers, her various expeditions and walks through the city, and the warmth with 
            which she describes the friends that she met there, suggest that her stay in 
            Marseille was, in spite of the guidebooks,
            quite pleasant. Perhaps
            she, unlike Murray, Siddons, and Rolfe, had an appreciation for the sea-port town
            that came with her maritime experience, or perhaps simply from having arrived after
            
            a very long 54 days at sea.</p>
         
         
         
         
         <p><strong>Aboard a Merchant
               Vessel</strong></p>  
         
         <p>The voyages Louisa Doane's father,
            Captain Edmund Doane, undertook were
            primarily in the service of larger merchants and other industries. As
            captain of a merchant vessel, Captain
            Doane's daily routine involved an absolute awareness and intricate
            negotiation of responsibility for the temporary ownership of the ship's
            cargo. <cite>The American Ship-Master's Daily Assistant</cite>,
            an 1807 guide to maritime law, clearly suggests that the primary concern for
            the master of any vessel was his responsibility for the ship's cargo
            (<cite>The American Ship-Master's
               Daily Assistant</cite> 1). According to maritime laws,
            the master of the vessel remained responsible for all damages occurring to
            cargo once aboard. The only exceptions to these laws were any damages
            attributed to "an act of God" and theft by piracy at sea. Any damage
            occurring due to poor ship maintenance (water damage for example), theft
            occurring while at port, damage by the crew or sailors, and even damage by
            rats was deemed the legal responsibility of the captain. This principle of
            responsibility significantly shapes life onboard including issues of
            discipline and the emphasis Louisa Doane
            gives to the animal life onboard.</p>
         
         <p>Although the owners of the ship were
            responsible for the cost of any damages needing attention that were not the
            fault of the captain or crew, the captain was required to pull into a port
            as soon as possible once damage detrimental to the ship and ship's cargo
            occurred. When questioned, the master of the vessel had to be able immediate
            response to be the case, making ship's logs extremely important. Any damage
            occurring while at sea was to be declared immediately upon the arrival of
            the vessel into port. Often, damage attributed to "acts of God" would
            require confirmation by multiple sources. These sources included not only
            official documents like the captain's log and ship manifests, but also
            testimonies by crew members or passengers. Not only does the captain's
            responsibility for the cargo explain Louisa
            Doane's repeated remarks about her father's concern for the ship's official documents (logs and
            manifests), but may also explain her meticulous notations of weather and
            conditions at sea throughout the journal as well as her meticulous
            documentation of agents embarkation and debarkation while at port in
            Marseilles and Acapulco.</p>
         
         <p>The decade of the clipper ship domination
            saw an expansion of commercial interests that Louisa
            Doane's journal was clearly a part of. Although readers see
            Doane's ship stopping at various ports
            for different exchanges, one of the most fascinating episodes includes their
            trip to obtain guano from islands of the
            coast of Peru . The guano industry in the mid-nineteenth century
            marks a unique period in the development of international commercial
            interests, with some scholars declaring the guano industry and the 1856
            "Guano Act" to be the first clear attempt by the
            United States to secure international commercial resources through
            legislation ("Chap. CLXIV.-An
            Act to Authorize Protection" 119). However, the
            guano episode in Louisa Doane's journal
            suggests that early in the 1850's, the market developed so quickly that a
            clear public knowledge of what the product was or what it was to be used for
            was not entirely clear.</p>
         
         <p>Despite the impetus to proceed with caution
            to preserve precious cargo like the guano obtained from the Lobos Islands, Captain
            Edmund Doane's journeys were chartered by pioneers of the
            transportaion industry, each with particular attachments to developments in
            merchant vessels. The specific companies operating in the background of
            Doane's journeys include the merchant company Howland
            and Aspinwall who chartered part of their voyage, and the
            paternrship of Foster's and Nickerson who were
            partial owners of the <i>Commonwealth</i>. Howland and Aspinwall was a prestigious firm at
            the forefront of transportation developments in the mid-nineteenth century.
            The firm is credited with funding the construction of innovative streamlined
            ship designs like the <i>Sea Witch</i> that travelled
            from New York to China in a record
            seventy-nine days in 1849. Shipbuilding and merchant companies like the
            parternship created by Foster and Nickerson were
            not only deeply involved in this boom of shipbuilding, but were also
            particularly invested in the speed of ships rounding Cape Horn. Records set by ships such as the <i>Sea Witch</i> not only kept companies like Howland and Aspinwall at the forefront of
            commercial interests, but created a shipbuilding market driven by a desire
            for faster transportation. The partnership between Foster
            and Nickerson began, and continued with the desrire to charter
            faster ships around Cape Horn. This
            shared desire for faster transportation not only paved the way for what the
            <cite>American National Biography</cite> defined as a "decade
            of clipper ship domination of the American deepwater trade" (Delgado 4), but also created a
            competitive drive between captains, evidenced by what became known as the
            "Deep Sea Derby" race around Cape Horn in
            1852. Although the Doanes' journey around the Cape was not solely to transport goods from New York to San Francisco
            like most ships involved in the race, this competitive drive can be felt in
            Doane's comparison of the speed and
            location of other ships with the <i>Commonwealth</i>.

         <h3 id="capehorn">Cape Horn - The long dreaded Place.</h3>
         
         <p> <br>Cape Horn holds a unique place in
            the lore and ritual of sea travel. (“Rounding the Horn,” traveling from 50 degrees South in
            the Atlantic to 50 degrees South in the Pacific, was and is a difficult, dangerous,
            and time
            consuming maritime rite of passage.) Doane’s calculation and records of Latitude and
            Longitude allow us to travel with her on a journey that belongs to a unique time—and
            place.
            </p>
         
         <p>The epoch of sailing around the Horn in search of guano was incredibly brief. The
            Peruvian
            guano trade was profitable, but short lived. At the time of Doane’s journey in 1852, sailing
            around Cape Horn was the only way to “efficiently” move goods and people from Atlantic to
            Pacific. There was no naturally occurring break between North and South America, from
            the
            Arctic Circle all the way to Cape Horn. The transcontinental railroad would not be completed
            until 1869, and the Panama Canal was not finished until 1914. Before the completion
            of the
            Canal and the availability of overland shipping, barks, windjammers, and other vessels
            sailed all the way around the tip of South America to reach the other side of North
            America.
            </p>
         
         <p>Particularly in the immediate aftermath of the gold rush, the Drake Passage became
            a
            busy shipping lane. Gathering guano from the Chincha Islands, the purpose of Doane’s
            journey, added more traffic to the sea. Dangerous and uncomfortable as it was, merchant
            marines, passenger ships, and those who longed to move to California, during and after
            the
            gold rush, made the journey round the Horn. </p>
         
         
         <p>Standing at Latitude 55 degrees 59 minutes South and Longitude 67 degrees 16 minutes
            West,
            Cape Horn is the southernmost point of
            South America. It marks the northern boundary of the Drake Passage, the 600 mile stretch
            of ocean
            between the rocky island and Antarctica, which is commonly considered the stormiest
            portion
            of ocean in the world.</p>
         
         
         <p>(Dallas Murphy) reproduces ship owners’
            instructions to captains in his authoritative celebration of Cape
            Horn, <cite>Rounding the Horn: Being the Story of
               Williwaws and Windjammers, Drake, Darwin, Murdered Missionaries and Naked Natives,
               a
               Deck's Eye View of Cape
               Horn</cite>: “The
            winds blow almost continuously from the west, and although gales do not last so long
            in
            summer as in winter, they are more frequent and stronger.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. In short, navigation
            is
            nowhere more difficult than in these waters” (253)</p>
         
         
         <p>The dangers and discomfort of the journey have been thoroughly documented. Two other
            journals
            from 1852, one by (Joseph Samson) and the other by (Lucy Kendall Herrick), also recount journeys around
            Cape Horn. Rounding the Horn, the vagaries of wind and weather and the amount of human
            misery caused by both, figures prominently in both. Doane, who made her journey in the same
            year, certainly acknowledges some of the hardships. </p>
         
         
         <p>But while (Kendall) uses hyperbolic terms to describe her experience and (Samson) titled his book
            after that particular landmark, Doane acknowledges it with
            a simple, evocative phrase in her November 1 entry: “the long dreaded Place.” Her
            descriptions of the sailors’ efforts to keep the ship safe are matter of fact about
            wild
            water and wind. They adjust their sails before the wind, and try to cope with rolling
            seas.
            For example on Nov 8, she describes the night: “a heavy Squall came and the
            wind blowing a Huricane […] The wind howling through the rigging and the waves running
            high
            and washing over us continually the vessel diving into the sea very deep.”</p>
         
         
         <p>Her even-handed account of a place that had (by then) acquired a reputation for savagery
            is
            a valuable addition to the resource of familiar papers. Cape Horn
            occupied a romantic place in the popular imagination of
            mid-nineteenth-century Americans—it was viewed as the end of the Earth. Other discourses
            are
            dominated by the discovery of “naked natives” and the deaths of missionaries who came
            to
            convert the Yahgon. Doane does not dwell on these discourses; her writing focuses on the
            height of the waves and the situation it creates for sailors without mittens. </p>

         <p>This edition belongs to a series of collaboratively produced electronic editions of
            previously unpublished nineteenth-century American manuscripts held in the Rare Books
            and Manuscripts Library (RBMS) at The Ohio State University Libraries. Other editions
            include "Selected Entries from the Lucius Clark Smith Diaries,
            30 July 1862 to 31 December 1862"; "My Dear Elizabeth," five letters written by Sophia
            Peabody Hawthorne to her
            sister Elizabeth Palmer Peabody between ca. 1837 and 1868; "Journal of a Tour to Europe,"
            
            by Samuel Sullivan Cox; and "Selected Letters from the Ivan S. Gilbert Collection
            of 
            Stephens Family Travel Letters and Ephemera."</p>
         
         
         <p>Each text was initially edited in connection with an undergraduate or graduate course
            on electronic textual editing offered by H. Lewis Ulman, Associate Professor of
            English at The Ohio State University. The courses provided students with an
            opportunity to explore issues of textuality and mediation that arise when our
            cultural archives spread from page to screen and from library shelves to networked
            databases. Electronic textual editing served as each class's context for examining
            what happens—and envisioning what might happen—when artifacts in one medium are
            represented in another medium, especially with regard to the interpretive work of
            reading. Electronic textual editions also provided a contact zone that helped
            students reflect on what manuscript, print, and "born digital" artifacts can tell
            us
            about their unique properties and their relationships to one another.</p>
         
         
         <p>While the students' work focused on providing reliable textual editions, they also
            explored four threads inextricably woven into the work of electronic textual editing:
            the lives and historical milieu evoked by the texts; the history, characteristics,
            and preservation of physical and digital texts; the editorial processes and decisions
            that shape particular interpretations and presentations texts; and the mediation of
            electronic delivery systems.</p>
         
         
         <p>These conceptual focuses, along with the time constraints of academic terms and the
            need to train students who had, typically, no prior experience in textual editing
            or
            the various technologies employed in electronic textual editing, strongly influenced
            the selection of texts in this series. Working with curators in the RBMS, Professor
            Ulman identified previously unpublished manuscript materials that were of potentially
            broad interest and that reflected a curatorial focus of the RBMS collection—for
            example, letters and personal diaries that connect private lives with larger
            historical contexts. Focusing on unique manuscript materials not, in all but one
            case, associated with other copies or later published versions also eliminated the
            need to compare multiple copies or states of the same work, perhaps held in other
            archives, an impractical task in the course of an academic term. Other practical
            matters also informed the choice of materials, including the possibility of scanning
            the source documents before the class so that students could work with both the
            original documents and high-resolutions facsimiles as they transcribed and encoded
            the source texts.</p>
         
         
         <p>Thus, the editions in this series are documentary editions—interpretations and
            representations of single documents—designed to provide wider exposure and access
            to
            manuscript materials that might otherwise be overlooked, and to provide users with
            a
            variety of tools for studying those texts.</p>
         
         
         <p>While providing a reliable textual edition is a sine qua non, the Doane edition also
            explores ways of telling four stories inextricably woven into our work: the lives
            and
            historical milieu evoked by the texts, the history of the physical documents, the
            editorial process that gave rise to this particular interpretation of the texts, and
            the
            mediation of our electronic delivery system. </p>
         
         
         <p> Over the course of several years following the classes in which students worked on
            the editions, Professor Ulman revised the introductory materials to ensure stylistic
            consistency and proofed the transcription and encoding. He also redesigned the
            structure of the editions to meet the requirements of Ohio State's institutional
            repository, evolving accessibility standards, and feedback from peer reviewers.
            However, he did not undertake a complete retranscription of the source text or
            revision of the students' introductory essays and annotations.</p>

            <strong>Scanning</strong>. The manuscript pages were scanned as 24-bit TIFF images
            at 400 dots per inch (dpi), then coverted to 8-bit JPEG images at 400 dpi and full
            quality. All edges were overscanned by at least 1/4 inch. No color correction was
            used at any stage of image
            preparation, but a scan of a photographer's 18% grey card on the same scanner
            produced RGB values at the center of 91/95/107 after applying a 150% Gaussian Blur
            in
            Adobe Photoshop to average color values. Thus, a properly configured monitor should

         <p><strong>Markup and Annotation</strong>. XML encoding of the Doane journal follows The
            Text Encoding Initiative's (TEI) <cite>P5: Guidelines for Electronic Text Encoding and Interchange</cite>,
            as customized for the project using the TEI's ODD ("One Document Does it All") process.
            This editorial introduction and the three "views" of the letters were generated from
            the main XML file
            using XSL transformations to produce HTML Web pages. Several of the appendices were
            encoded in HTML separately.
            A more detailed description of the markup can be found via the "Appendices" menu,
            and all source files
            (XML, XSL, CSS, ODD, RNC) can be viewed and downloaded via the "Source Files" menu.</p>

            XML
            document. Other explanatory annotations are linked directly from the text. Separate
            appendices provide 
            further information about the project (e.g., acknowledgements, editors' bios, and

            <strong>Proofing</strong>. Students who created the original transcriptions proofread their own
            transcription and encoding. In preparation for peer review by NINES and preservation
            in The Ohio State University's 
            Knowledge Bank, the transcriptions and encoding were once again proofread by Professor
            Ulman.
            </p>
         
         <p>
            <strong>Peer Review</strong>. Anonymous reviewers for NINES provided peer-reviews for the editions, in response
            to 
            which they were revised and then reviewed by NINES editors before being listed in
            the NINES database.
